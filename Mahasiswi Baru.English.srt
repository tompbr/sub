1
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:29,041
This is not
an Independence Day celebration

2
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:31,750
and I am not a dance instructor.

3
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:34,666
My name is Lastri,

4
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,958
I'm a freshman...

5
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,583
and this is my story.

6
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:51,416
Like every story,
there's always a beginning.

7
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:57,000
I'd like a refund for my plane ticket.

8
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:02,750
I don't want to change the date,
I want to cancel my flight. That's it.

9
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:07,416
My daughter can't go.

10
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:19,958
Where are you going, Mother?

11
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:22,500
I am going to campus.

12
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:26,458
You're applying as a student?

13
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:27,541
Yes.

14
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:29,291
Is there a problem?

15
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,375
But, ma'am...

16
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:31,625
What's your religion?

17
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:33,833
What does religion have to do with it?

18
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:36,666
Do you believe in God?

19
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:40,375
Yes, I do believe in God.

20
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:42,458
If you believe in God,

21
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:47,125
then you know that God
always listens to a mother's prayer.

22
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:52,208
You want me to pray good things for you,

23
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:53,416
or bad things?

24
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:58,416
We are going to take your picture.

25
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:04,000
Just act normal, ma'am.

26
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,291
UNIVERSITY CYBER INDONESIA

27
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:10,208
Alhamdulillah. Thank you God.

28
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:14,583
Thank you, thank you.

29
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:19,333
Welcome to Cyber Indonesia University.

30
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:23,541
This is a place where you
can be cool in your community

31
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:25,666
by saying,

32
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:28,041
"I am a Berdosa."

33
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:32,875
An abbreviation of Cyber Indonesia.

34
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:34,791
You only have one enemy.

35
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:39,833
That is the students of Institut Sains
Dan Pendidikan.

36
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:43,000
Or in short, Insap.

37
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:47,416
The Berdosas are enemies of the Insaps.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,208
Stupid.

39
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:53,875
Look over here.

40
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,833
A millennial.

41
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,791
An attention seeking generation.

42
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:08,000
Miss, we were born between 1990-2000,
they call us

43
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,833
the post millennial generation.

44
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:12,000
You're the millennials.

45
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:13,458
Shut it!

46
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:17,416
What is this?
Why are you wearing a high school uniform?

47
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,708
You want to look cute,
you want to look like Gempi?

48
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:23,583
-What is Gempi?
-"What is Gempi?"

49
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,541
Why wear a costume like this?

50
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:30,208
Isn't this orientation?

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,250
Orientation? That's so old school.

52
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:39,916
Why did you wear a pan as a hat?

53
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,333
Dear God.

54
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:43,750
Why did you throw it?

55
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,166
You don't need that pan!

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,416
Are you also wearing a hairpiece?

57
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,125
-No.
-She is wearing a hairpiece.

58
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:51,708
-Just take it off!
-That hurts!

59
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:52,708
Take it off!

60
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:57,708
-Take it off.
-That hurts. Really.

61
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,083
This is her real hair.

62
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:04,875
Then, clean your make up.
Just clean your face.

63
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,583
Why do you want to look old?

64
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,458
This is my real look.

65
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,291
Why do you want to look old?

66
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:15,333
People want to look young.
Why do you want to look old?

67
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:18,583
-I am old.
-When were you born?

68
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,083
-Seventy years ago.
-What?

69
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:31,791
Please forgive me, Grandma.

70
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:35,083
Please forgive me, Grandma.
I am really sorry.

71
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,083
Forgiven. Stop it. Come on, get up.

72
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:42,791
Grandma...

73
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,208
Are you really a grandmother?

74
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:50,375
-Of course.
-You remind me of my grandma.

75
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,166
You know...

76
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,166
My grandma is...

77
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:57,875
She is a grandmother.

78
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:02,000
Please forgive me, grandma.
I didn't mean it.

79
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,041
Grandma!

80
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:08,833
Hi, still with me, Danny Asolole.

81
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:12,833
Listen, there is a senior citizen
registered at Cyber Indonesia.

82
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,375
The wrinkles on her face are real.

83
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:15,583
Shut it!

84
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:16,791
Kak.

85
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,458
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

86
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,291
Sandiaga Anu?

87
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,333
Sandiaga Uno.

88
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:28,208
I am a senior. So what if I say Anu?

89
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:30,041
Nothing, Kak.

90
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:42,500
This is your first day,
and yet, some of you are late.

91
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:47,166
You're university students.

92
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:50,333
You're no longer primary students,

93
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:54,083
that still need to be looked after
by your parents.

94
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:55,833
Do you understand?

95
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,083
Good morning.

96
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:10,083
I am really sorry, this is my daughter.

97
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:11,291
It might be important.

98
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,500
Whose mother is that?

99
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,375
She is one of the freshmen, Sir.

100
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:18,500
But she is old.

101
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,333
What is it, dear?

102
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:29,125
Can you turn off your cell phone, Grandma?

103
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,166
What?

104
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:34,583
You mean the pan? The small pan?

105
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:37,291
Yes, I brought it here, but...

106
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,833
Turn off the phone.

107
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:45,916
Okay, Sir. I have to go.

108
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:50,625
Let me introduce myself.
I am Chaerul Umam.

109
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:56,583
Welcome to Cyber Indonesia University.

110
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,458
-This morning...
-I have a question.

111
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,625
This is not a question and answer session.

112
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,958
Why was it named Cyber Indonesia?

113
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,125
Why don't you use Bahasa Indonesia?

114
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:12,250
That's too western.

115
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:15,125
We are trying to embrace

116
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:21,625
the Industrial Revolution 4.0.

117
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,166
So...

118
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:29,750
I am answering your question.

119
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:36,333
What is the Industrial Revolution 4.0?

120
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,833
I don't know anything about that.

121
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:47,250
How would I knowÂ 
about Industrial Revolution 4.0?

122
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,583
That's why I asked him.

123
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,750
We shouldn't be afraid to ask questions.

124
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:53,958
You're right.

125
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,625
And what did the professor do?

126
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,000
He is not a professor. He is the dean.

127
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:03,041
That Chaerul really looks like
a puffer fish.

128
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,875
Maybe he is holding his anger against me.

129
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,125
-Mom?
-Yes?

130
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,291
Why did you put four plates on the table?

131
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:23,833
I couldn't help it.

132
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:32,625
Assalamualaikum.

133
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,000
Wa'alaikumsalam.

134
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,625
-Hi, Dear.
-Mas.

135
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,875
I am so hungry.

136
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,791
That fish looks so...

137
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:50,916
Here.

138
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,916
I cooked the fish with different
spices. Have a try.

139
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,875
Okay.

140
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:07,083
Good morning, Grandma.

141
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:08,541
Just call me Lastri.

142
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,291
Hi, Grandma.

143
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:12,500
Just call me Lastri.

144
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,666
Mr. Chaerul said hello.

145
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,583
Really?

146
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:25,333
Grandma.

147
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,333
Good morning, Grandma.

148
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:29,833
Good morning.

149
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,250
Just call me Lastri.

150
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,458
No, that's not polite.

151
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:38,458
I am the one asking you.
Come on, try calling me Lastri.

152
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:44,125
Good morning, Lastri.

153
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:48,000
Easy, right?

154
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,250
What class are you taking, Lastri?

155
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,750
Introduction to Communication.

156
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,416
-We are in the same class.
-Really?

157
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,291
Let's go to class.

158
00:09:57,666 --> 00:10:00,541
This is our first day.
What are we going to do?

159
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,875
We are going to play a prank on someone.

160
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:05,541
Who am I going to prank this time?

161
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:10,291
Who is going to be my victim?

162
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,541
This is going to be fun. Stay tuned.

163
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,416
What are you doing?

164
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,791
I am planning a prank for my vlog.

165
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,416
That's disgusting.

166
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,500
Can you walk faster?

167
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,500
Reva?

168
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:32,333
Did you just wake up?

169
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,375
No, ma'am.

170
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,375
Just call me Lastri.

171
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,916
-Do you have class today?
-Yes.

172
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,083
What class?

173
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,708
Introduction to communication.

174
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,041
Good.

175
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,083
We are in the same class.

176
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,250
Come on. Wait, wait.

177
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:56,333
We have to fix your hair,
to make you look beautiful.

178
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,416
Come on.

179
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:04,833
Good morning, everyone.

180
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,166
Good morning.

181
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:09,875
I am Lastri.

182
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,125
Just call me Lastri, okay?

183
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,208
Hi, miss. I am Lastri.

184
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,708
-Good morning.
-Hi.

185
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,583
-Should I sit here?
-No, Grandma.

186
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,291
Just call me Lastri.

187
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:32,666
-Yes, Grandma Lastri.
-Without grandma, just Lastri.

188
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,750
Okay. You can't sit here, Lastri.

189
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,833
What's up with him?

190
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:40,208
He's weird. Just sit anyway.

191
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:44,291
No, no.

192
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,916
What is wrong with you?

193
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,958
No.

194
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,333
Good morning, everyone.

195
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,583
Good morning, sir.

196
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,583
Get ready for your first quiz.

197
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:58,333
What quiz? We just got the text book.

198
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,125
-Come on, it's our first day.
-Quiz, really?

199
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,083
Excuse me, sir.

200
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:04,625
This is our first day in class,
we haven't learned anything.

201
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,375
How can you quiz us?

202
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,416
Did you get the text book?

203
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:12,625
Yes.

204
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:15,333
-When was that?
-Last week.

205
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:18,958
So you had one week to read the book.

206
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,083
What's the problem?

207
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,000
Anyone ready for the quiz?

208
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,625
-What is with you?
-You're such a brown noser.

209
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:31,375
See? Some of you are ready for the quiz.

210
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:35,333
Okay. Let me ask you, guys.

211
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,791
Who is against the quiz?

212
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:38,791
Me! Me!

213
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:40,041
Me, guys.

214
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,750
See? There's only one thing to do.

215
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:43,958
No quiz!

216
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:45,083
No quiz!

217
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:50,458
No quiz! No quiz! No quiz!

218
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:53,208
No quiz! No quiz! No quiz!

219
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,000
No quiz! No quiz! No quiz!

220
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:58,708
No quiz! No quiz! No quiz!

221
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:01,500
No quiz! No quiz!

222
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,916
-Stop.
-No quiz! No quiz!

223
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,458
Oh, no!

224
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:08,000
Grandma!

225
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,833
Help!

226
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:19,750
Pull the chair out!

227
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,958
Come on, stand her up!

228
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,375
Silence!

229
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,583
I just want to be straight with you.

230
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,958
This is between me and you.

231
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,208
We are old.

232
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:47,250
I don't understand, what is it

233
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:51,625
that encourages you
to study in this faculty?

234
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:59,250
Do you really think you can
compete with these young people?

235
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:04,833
You're just goingÂ 
to bring shame on yourself,

236
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,958
and make a mockery of this faculty,

237
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:14,208
which I built with hard work.

238
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,833
Mister Chaerul,

239
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:28,041
I'd like to enjoy my life to the maximum.

240
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,958
No one knows how long
they still have to live...

241
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,958
Don't you realize that...

242
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:40,541
I can't overturn the rectorate's decision

243
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:43,458
to accept a senior citizen like you
as a student?

244
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,583
But I am the dean here.

245
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:50,416
I have the right to decide

246
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,666
what kind of student

247
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:57,041
is allowed in my faculty.

248
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:00,125
So,

249
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:05,166
after the end of the semester,

250
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:09,208
if your grade is below average,

251
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,708
I will be forced to do something.

252
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,041
Do you understand?

253
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:21,250
Okay, I will prove to you

254
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:24,500
that I can get good grades.

255
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:29,375
And I will uphold the reputation
of your faculty.

256
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,708
Please sign this online petition.

257
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,541
I have put the link on it. Thanks.

258
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:04,333
Please sign this online petition.

259
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,416
Good morning, Grandma.

260
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,541
Just call me Lastri.

261
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:11,416
Lastri, please sign our petition.

262
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,916
-Against the spontaneous quiz.
-What is this?

263
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,125
I am with you on this.

264
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:21,250
I have put the link here,
open it from your cell phone...

265
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,708
-to support my online petition.
-I need a cell phone for that?

266
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:24,666
Yes.

267
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,583
-Can you show me? I don't know how.
-Okay.

268
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,708
Dear God.

269
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:37,708
You can't do it with that phone.
Just support us anyway.

270
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,666
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

271
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,833
-Yes.
-Okay, then.

272
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,750
Yes, I have something new.

273
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,791
I have something interesting here.

274
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:54,791
I am going to interview the grandma
who went viral yesterday.

275
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,000
Who is that? It is Lastri.

276
00:16:57,333 --> 00:17:01,458
The freshman at Berdosa, guys.

277
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:02,666
-Come on, Lastri.
-Yes?

278
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,500
Say, hi.

279
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,208
What is it?

280
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:10,333
Hi. Are they boys or girls?

281
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:14,958
We have thousandsÂ of boys and girlsÂ 
at Baladanny.

282
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:19,541
Look, there are 1,200 boys and girls live.
Asolole, right?

283
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,000
-There are a lots of them.
-Sure.

284
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:24,000
No, my battery is low.

285
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,250
You have lots of friends.

286
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:29,791
They're not my friends,
they're my followers.

287
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:35,000
They follow my updates,
my daily activities.

288
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,958
They listen to my rants.

289
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,875
They're not your friendsÂ 
but you share your feelings with them?

290
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,041
I see them as friends,

291
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,583
but they're not my real friends.
They're my followers.

292
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,125
Please sign the petition.

293
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,625
What is this?

294
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:54,541
Trash.

295
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:57,166
-What are you doing?
-This is trash.

296
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,875
What did you say?

297
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:02,250
I said, this is trash. You don't like it?

298
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:03,500
Of course not!

299
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,000
What's happening over there?

300
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:08,416
Erfan! We have to help Erfan.

301
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,375
Hi, guys.

302
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,291
Look, Grandma Lastri got hit!

303
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:20,375
Look, Lastri!

304
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:56,000
In the old days,

305
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,583
even the worst of the students,

306
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:05,333
never make trouble two days in a row.

307
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,166
Shame on you.

308
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:14,333
And you, when I was young,

309
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:20,208
the elders were a role model
to the young people.

310
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:32,000
So, this is why

311
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:35,666
you didn't attend class.

312
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:41,458
As a student, I have the freedomÂ 
to exercise democracy.

313
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,958
I can express whatever I want.

314
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:49,166
A student called me lazy,
so I punched him.

315
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:53,083
You talk about democracy

316
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:56,750
but you hit others who
don't share your opinion?

317
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,875
Do you really know the meaning
of democracy?

318
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:03,958
And you...

319
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:05,916
Yes, you.

320
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:10,500
I have to tell you the truth.

321
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:15,583
You do not belong here.

322
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:20,291
At the end of the semester,

323
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,791
if your grade is below average,

324
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,625
I will expel you.

325
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:31,125
I worked hard to build this faculty.

326
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:34,166
Sweat and tears. I won't let it go down.

327
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,916
Understood?

328
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,875
Dear God.

329
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:43,500
This is not a question and answer session!

330
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:46,875
-If I get...
-Enough!

331
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,166
What is this?

332
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:57,125
Please calm down, guys.

333
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,541
Mr. Chaerul is always like that.

334
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,583
It has to be his way.

335
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,500
Whatever he wants.

336
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:13,000
Guys, can I borrow your power bank?

337
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:19,583
You caused all of this.

338
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:24,041
Why did you have to make those flyers?

339
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:26,916
As a student I can express
whatever I feel.

340
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
No one said you can't.

341
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,791
But someone has to tell you
not to be lazy and stupid.

342
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,375
Don't call me stupid!

343
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,875
No one has a power bank?

344
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:44,208
Danny.

345
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,958
The world won't end
if your phone is off for a while.

346
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,458
Come on, stop it!

347
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:54,166
I need to go home.

348
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:04,375
Lastri!

349
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,208
Help!

350
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:09,708
Come on, guys. Help.

351
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:27,083
Mother.

352
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:33,625
How do you feel, Lastri?

353
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:36,375
I feel better, dear.

354
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:39,000
We need to take you
to the hospital, Lastri.

355
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,125
Maybe she has a concussion.

356
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,916
I'd be dead if I had a concussion.

357
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:50,083
Enough. You need to get out of here.

358
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:52,958
My mother needs to rest. Come on, out.

359
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:54,666
-See you, Lastri.
-Come on.

360
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:57,583
I have lived for more than 40 years,

361
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:03,583
never in my life,
have I called my mother by her name.

362
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:07,791
You've only known her for a week.

363
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:10,125
Where are your manners?

364
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:15,375
She asked us to call her Lastri.

365
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:19,250
What if she asked you to call her...

366
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:22,166
What is it you people call
someone these days?

367
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,625
-Guys?
-Bor.

368
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:25,583
-Coy?
-Coy?

369
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,375
Netizen is always right?

370
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:30,083
Okay, whatever that is.

371
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:34,500
So, you will call her whatever she wants?

372
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:37,000
-Yes, guys.
-What?

373
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:40,083
Okay, listen.

374
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:42,791
If something happens to her...

375
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:44,625
What are you laughing at?

376
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:47,083
-Nothing.
-This is serious.

377
00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:50,166
If something happens to my mother
on campus,

378
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,666
I am going to sue all of you!

379
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,041
-Do you understand?
-Yes, guys.

380
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:57,458
-And you? You?
-Yes, we understand.

381
00:23:57,875 --> 00:23:58,958
Good.

382
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:16,208
Crazy kids.

383
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,750
We have to avenge her.

384
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:26,708
What? Anna is right to be mad at us.

385
00:24:26,791 --> 00:24:28,833
I'm not talking about Anna.

386
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:31,166
We have to avenge the boys who hit Lastri.

387
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:33,041
Do you agree?

388
00:24:34,166 --> 00:24:35,208
I agree.

389
00:24:35,666 --> 00:24:38,083
I agree. It's good for my content.

390
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:41,708
It's up to you guys.
I don't want to be a part of it. See you.

391
00:24:41,791 --> 00:24:44,166
Hey, where's your loyalty?

392
00:24:46,083 --> 00:24:48,500
Can I borrow your power bank, guys?

393
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:51,166
Please, guys.

394
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:54,000
You say that once again,
I'll punch your face. Come on.

395
00:24:54,541 --> 00:24:56,291
I haven't charged my phone.

396
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,291
Okay, Baladanny, as promised...

397
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:06,083
This is so good.
We are going to avenge Lastri.

398
00:25:07,833 --> 00:25:10,416
We're just waiting for Erfan. Where is he?

399
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,000
-Have you found them?
-Yes, they're over there.

400
00:25:13,083 --> 00:25:14,625
There.

401
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:17,833
Go for it!

402
00:25:18,666 --> 00:25:20,041
-This is good, guys.
-Erfan!

403
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:22,583
-He brought a wooden stick.
-What are you doing, Erfan?

404
00:25:23,375 --> 00:25:25,541
Hey, what did you do to Lastri?

405
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:28,291
-Let's run!
-Where are you going? You want to run?

406
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:29,791
You don't have to hit him.

407
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:31,583
-I have to.
-Let him go.

408
00:25:31,666 --> 00:25:34,708
Just go, Mas. Just go.

409
00:25:34,791 --> 00:25:35,916
Hey, wait, wait!

410
00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:39,875
Aren't you Angela? I met you at...

411
00:25:39,958 --> 00:25:41,041
Ouch!

412
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:46,583
You were the one who told me
not to hit him.

413
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,500
It was an accident.

414
00:25:53,083 --> 00:25:58,458
The moral of the story, guys:
violence will not solve a problem.

415
00:25:58,541 --> 00:26:00,750
-Asolole?
-Come on, just go!

416
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:19,916
Assalamualaikum. I'm so hungry.

417
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:25,000
Sorry, I'm late. There was... Dear God!

418
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,875
What happened to you, Mother?

419
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:30,833
I smoked some pot,

420
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:34,041
and I fell from a motorcycle.

421
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,000
Dear God. Mother.

422
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:40,208
Ask for God's forgiveness.
Remember your age, Mom.

423
00:26:42,166 --> 00:26:44,375
I'm kidding.

424
00:26:45,916 --> 00:26:48,000
-What happened?
-Well, Mas,

425
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:51,875
Mother was involved in a fight.

426
00:26:51,958 --> 00:26:54,000
What?

427
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:55,916
Pot is so much better than fighting.

428
00:26:56,416 --> 00:26:58,625
Neither's good.

429
00:26:59,291 --> 00:27:00,625
I am fine.

430
00:27:01,541 --> 00:27:04,000
Didn't you look at yourself in the mirror?

431
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:08,375
Your face is swollen.
What if your eyes had got hit?

432
00:27:08,958 --> 00:27:11,083
That is why I never agreed
for you to go to college.

433
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,541
What for?

434
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:18,041
Since when, does a mother has
to ask permission from her daughter?

435
00:27:18,541 --> 00:27:22,791
You live in my house.

436
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:26,500
You have to follow our rules.

437
00:27:27,916 --> 00:27:29,000
Right, dear?

438
00:27:30,208 --> 00:27:33,208
I'm just going to keep quiet.

439
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:40,000
What is your problem?

440
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:43,208
My problem is, I am hungry.

441
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:50,250
I don't want to stay up,

442
00:27:50,791 --> 00:27:54,250
waiting for someoneÂ 
that might never come home.

443
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,250
Are you afraid that I am going to die?

444
00:27:59,125 --> 00:28:01,125
Just like what happened to Rianti?

445
00:28:03,416 --> 00:28:04,541
Mother.

446
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:08,125
You can't bring back the dead, mom.

447
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:09,541
Enough!

448
00:28:10,208 --> 00:28:11,500
Anna.

449
00:28:11,583 --> 00:28:14,458
You don't even want to hear her name.

450
00:28:14,541 --> 00:28:18,541
I haven't finished talking, Anna!

451
00:28:18,625 --> 00:28:19,875
Come back here!

452
00:28:26,916 --> 00:28:30,125
Your wife is so stubborn.

453
00:28:30,833 --> 00:28:34,375
Maybe she takes after the neighbors.

454
00:28:34,458 --> 00:28:36,750
Because you're not like that.

455
00:28:39,541 --> 00:28:41,500
Are you trying to be funny?

456
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:45,333
I'm just trying to have dinner...

457
00:28:45,833 --> 00:28:48,708
Just finish your meal.
No one asked you to stop.

458
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:52,875
I am just a guest in this house!

459
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:06,625
My life is so hard, fish.

460
00:29:21,083 --> 00:29:26,958
What a beautiful design, right guys?
Very professional.

461
00:29:27,041 --> 00:29:29,916
This is Sara.
A young and talented designer.

462
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,666
Come on, say hi.

463
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,708
Hi, Baladanny.

464
00:29:34,541 --> 00:29:37,041
Your sketch is really nice. Thank you.

465
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:39,333
-There are lots of questions.
-Read it.

466
00:29:39,416 --> 00:29:43,166
Kak, how can I choose
the right fashion for me?

467
00:29:57,708 --> 00:29:58,833
Dear?

468
00:30:03,416 --> 00:30:04,833
Lastri.

469
00:30:05,541 --> 00:30:07,375
You spent the night here again?

470
00:30:09,666 --> 00:30:10,875
No.

471
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:12,916
Okay, then.

472
00:30:18,666 --> 00:30:20,375
You smell bad for a pretty girl.

473
00:30:23,541 --> 00:30:26,750
I am going to give you my perfume.

474
00:30:27,541 --> 00:30:29,250
-Perfume?
-Yes.

475
00:30:30,041 --> 00:30:31,458
So you'll smell nice.

476
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:38,916
Enough.

477
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,708
We have to put on some more
so you'll smell nice.

478
00:30:41,791 --> 00:30:43,625
I think that's enough.
I smell nice already.

479
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:45,500
Nice, right?

480
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:46,791
You also have to fix your hair.

481
00:30:46,875 --> 00:30:49,458
I think that's good.

482
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:53,250
-Thank you, Lastri.
-It's okay.

483
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:55,333
I have to go to class.

484
00:31:01,416 --> 00:31:02,541
Sorry.

485
00:31:04,958 --> 00:31:07,625
You smell like flowers
on a freshly dug grave.

486
00:31:12,833 --> 00:31:16,875
Can you put your mouth to rest?

487
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:29,791
I like that. Playing hard to get.

488
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:35,791
Today, I'd like you to write an essay

489
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:40,875
that describes
a mass communication theory.

490
00:31:40,958 --> 00:31:43,583
Go ahead. You may take out your laptop.

491
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:03,625
The grandma is using a typewriter, guys.

492
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:11,958
What are you doing?

493
00:32:12,583 --> 00:32:13,625
I'm typing, Sir.

494
00:32:13,958 --> 00:32:15,958
Yes, I can see that.

495
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,958
Then, why did you ask?

496
00:32:21,041 --> 00:32:22,750
Don't you have a laptop?

497
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:26,625
Laptop? They're too expensive, Sir.

498
00:32:26,916 --> 00:32:31,166
In my class, assignments
are to be submitted

499
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:35,125
as a soft copy. Not hard copies like this.

500
00:32:35,708 --> 00:32:39,875
Why don't you use letter stickers?
Stick the letters one by one.

501
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:43,625
This is a college of communication.

502
00:32:43,916 --> 00:32:46,166
Not a communication museum.

503
00:32:47,583 --> 00:32:49,041
Seriously.

504
00:33:06,666 --> 00:33:07,750
Lastri.

505
00:33:10,625 --> 00:33:12,500
Let's do homework together, okay?

506
00:33:12,708 --> 00:33:14,458
You can use my laptop.

507
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:19,083
-I can?
-Sure, you can.

508
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:23,166
Thank you, beautiful.

509
00:33:25,041 --> 00:33:27,208
Let's go to my dorm.
It's just around here.

510
00:33:28,958 --> 00:33:32,000
Guys, what's up? Can I join in?

511
00:33:32,666 --> 00:33:36,250
Baladannies are crazy about Lastri.
That's crazy.

512
00:33:36,333 --> 00:33:38,041
Lastri, say hi!

513
00:33:38,666 --> 00:33:40,458
Hi!

514
00:33:40,541 --> 00:33:42,250
Aselole!

515
00:33:42,666 --> 00:33:45,500
We're going to my dorm, to do homework.
Wanna join us?

516
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:47,708
Come.

517
00:33:50,708 --> 00:33:53,333
How about it, guys? Should we join them?

518
00:33:53,416 --> 00:33:55,750
Wait for me, guys. Sarah.

519
00:33:56,166 --> 00:33:58,208
You said you wanted to discuss patterns.

520
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:04,958
Dear?

521
00:34:05,875 --> 00:34:08,833
-Lastri?
-What are you doing here?

522
00:34:18,916 --> 00:34:21,791
Come to my dorm.Â 
Better than sitting alone here.

523
00:34:23,291 --> 00:34:28,375
Guys, do you think Reva will join us?

524
00:34:28,458 --> 00:34:31,083
Hey, guys. Please.

525
00:34:31,583 --> 00:34:33,125
-Come.
-Come on.

526
00:34:33,208 --> 00:34:36,166
Come!

527
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:39,291
What about Erfan? Should we ask him?

528
00:34:39,916 --> 00:34:41,583
He's part of the gang, guys.

529
00:34:42,458 --> 00:34:43,333
Huh?

530
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:48,583
-Are we really a gang now?
-I'm serious, Lastri.

531
00:34:48,666 --> 00:34:50,750
Good God! This is fun!

532
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:52,000
Aselole!

533
00:34:52,083 --> 00:34:55,250
-Isn't this fun?
-We're a gang!

534
00:34:55,333 --> 00:34:58,166
But, I don't want to get a tattoo.

535
00:35:01,291 --> 00:35:03,333
Okay, Danny, go invite Erfan.

536
00:35:03,416 --> 00:35:06,333
Message him, call him,
Instagram live, story, whatever. Come.

537
00:35:08,666 --> 00:35:09,708
What was that?

538
00:35:14,625 --> 00:35:18,166
Today I'm making a video
that's going to be my favorite.

539
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:22,500
Because this is how you find out
about one's personality.

540
00:35:22,875 --> 00:35:26,250
Okay, so it's time to tour Sarah's room!

541
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:27,541
What is it?

542
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:28,750
Wrong room?

543
00:35:28,833 --> 00:35:32,416
No. Wait a second.

544
00:35:32,875 --> 00:35:33,958
Wait. Sorry.

545
00:35:36,791 --> 00:35:38,458
This is so strange, guys.

546
00:35:39,625 --> 00:35:41,375
What happened to her?

547
00:35:51,666 --> 00:35:52,541
You're done?

548
00:35:53,541 --> 00:35:54,958
Okay. Come in.

549
00:35:55,041 --> 00:35:56,333
-May we?
-Yes, you may.

550
00:35:56,416 --> 00:35:59,208
-We can come in, guys.
-Have a seat.

551
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:00,333
What happened?

552
00:36:01,666 --> 00:36:06,166
It was too messy, Lastri.
So, I had to clean it up a bit.

553
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:10,000
This is so instagrammable, guys!

554
00:36:11,708 --> 00:36:13,750
Guys, can I charge my phone?

555
00:36:14,333 --> 00:36:15,791
The socket's right there.

556
00:36:21,041 --> 00:36:22,875
You have a very nice room, Sarah.

557
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:29,500
What about you?Â 
Do you live in a dorm, too?

558
00:36:29,583 --> 00:36:31,375
Or do you live with your parents?

559
00:36:31,958 --> 00:36:33,041
No.

560
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,375
Lastri, we should start doing
our homework.

561
00:36:57,458 --> 00:36:59,750
-Yes, let's get started.
-Let's.

562
00:37:02,708 --> 00:37:06,250
Anna, it's almost 9 p.m.

563
00:37:06,333 --> 00:37:08,458
Mom hasn't returned?

564
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:12,125
Have you called her?

565
00:37:13,166 --> 00:37:14,458
Her phone's inactive.

566
00:37:17,958 --> 00:37:21,125
-Lastri.
-Yes?

567
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:25,166
How does it look? Do you need help?

568
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:27,416
No, I'm almost done.

569
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,166
That was quick, Lastri.

570
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:31,666
You taught me well.

571
00:37:32,958 --> 00:37:35,750
Are you hungry? Let's order dinner.

572
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:38,958
No, I'm going to have dinner at home.

573
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:41,708
Oh, dear. Home! What time is it?

574
00:37:41,791 --> 00:37:44,041
Oh, God! It's 9 p.m.!

575
00:37:44,125 --> 00:37:47,500
My daughter will be waiting for me!

576
00:37:47,583 --> 00:37:50,750
Lastri, wait!
Your mom has entrusted you to us.

577
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:52,583
Did my mom rise from the grave?

578
00:37:52,666 --> 00:37:54,458
No! I meant Ibu Anna.

579
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:56,500
I'm afraid to get punished.
We'll take you home.

580
00:37:56,583 --> 00:37:58,000
Danny, wake up.

581
00:37:58,083 --> 00:38:00,583
-My followers...
-Ibu Anna will be furious! Hurry!

582
00:38:00,666 --> 00:38:03,416
-Oh, no!
-Wake up!

583
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,375
Come on, hurry!

584
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:09,208
Let's go! Hurry!

585
00:38:09,291 --> 00:38:12,875
Quick! Watch out!

586
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:15,708
Hurry up! Run!

587
00:38:15,791 --> 00:38:17,208
Sorry, guys. I'm late.

588
00:38:17,291 --> 00:38:19,416
Never mind, let's go.

589
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,291
What's happening?

590
00:38:22,375 --> 00:38:25,541
What's going on?

591
00:38:25,625 --> 00:38:27,750
Guys! Are you serious, guys?

592
00:38:27,833 --> 00:38:29,958
-What is it?
-I can't drive, guys!

593
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:35,500
Danny! Get out!

594
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:36,833
Stupid!

595
00:38:37,875 --> 00:38:39,958
Come on, hurry!

596
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,791
Guys, our mission tonightÂ 
is to take Lastri home.

597
00:38:49,875 --> 00:38:53,666
Isn't it crazy? We're really good friends.

598
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:55,208
Oh, no!

599
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:59,000
Anna!

600
00:39:01,666 --> 00:39:02,750
Amri!

601
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:05,708
Climb the fence. It's not that high.

602
00:39:07,083 --> 00:39:08,125
Are you serious?

603
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:12,791
Let's do it, guys.

604
00:39:13,125 --> 00:39:14,791
Hold this.

605
00:39:18,416 --> 00:39:20,375
-Dear God.
-Dear God is right.

606
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:21,625
Help us out, guys.

607
00:39:22,583 --> 00:39:25,333
-I'm not strong enough.
-Danny, get over there. Hop over.

608
00:39:25,416 --> 00:39:28,083
Yes! Pull her from the other side.

609
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:30,375
You do that! I'm supporting the foot!

610
00:39:30,458 --> 00:39:32,750
Hurry up! How can Lastri jump
if you do it like that?

611
00:39:32,833 --> 00:39:34,625
It's hard, guys!

612
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:38,000
You can do it. You're flexible!

613
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:39,791
It's hard.

614
00:39:42,541 --> 00:39:44,916
Hey, Anna!

615
00:39:47,416 --> 00:39:48,666
You're mad, aren't you?

616
00:39:50,875 --> 00:39:52,208
Should I jump now?

617
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:55,250
Aselole!

618
00:39:58,458 --> 00:40:01,416
Coming home late,
not answering your phone...

619
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,125
Why are you so reckless?

620
00:40:04,625 --> 00:40:07,750
Mom, what do you have to say?

621
00:40:09,625 --> 00:40:10,583
Calm down, Anna.

622
00:40:11,125 --> 00:40:14,708
I was invited to Sarah's dorm.

623
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:18,166
Look what you've done, Sarah.

624
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:21,000
Such a provocateur! You were there, too.

625
00:40:22,166 --> 00:40:26,208
Aunty, I'm sorry. I was just...

626
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:27,750
Stop.

627
00:40:27,833 --> 00:40:30,250
Enough excuses. I don't want to hear it.

628
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:33,166
Mom, why is your phone switched off?

629
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,708
It ran out of juice.

630
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,208
I wanted to charge it but the socket
was used by Danny for his phone.

631
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:43,541
No shame, Danny!

632
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:44,958
What a crime.

633
00:40:45,041 --> 00:40:46,666
It's not like that, guys!

634
00:40:49,125 --> 00:40:51,291
My name is Anna, not guys.

635
00:40:51,375 --> 00:40:54,416
-It's not like that, Anna.
-It's Mrs. Anna.

636
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:58,375
You're so inconsiderate.

637
00:40:58,458 --> 00:41:02,875
Why do you call the elderly
by their names?

638
00:41:03,875 --> 00:41:05,083
Mrs. Anna.

639
00:41:05,166 --> 00:41:10,333
Mom, you can call me Anna.

640
00:41:10,666 --> 00:41:13,791
Anna, don't overreact.

641
00:41:13,875 --> 00:41:17,875
Overreact?
Mom, I nearly had a heart attack.

642
00:41:18,166 --> 00:41:22,083
I can't wait like this anymore. I can't.

643
00:41:22,833 --> 00:41:26,583
That's it. You can't come home
so late at night.

644
00:41:26,666 --> 00:41:29,375
And don't hang out with them.

645
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,125
I forbid you.

646
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:36,458
I don't want to be restrained.

647
00:41:36,833 --> 00:41:39,333
They're my friends.

648
00:41:39,666 --> 00:41:41,500
Right, gang?

649
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,916
-Gang?
-Yes, gang.

650
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,833
Oh my God, Mom!

651
00:41:47,041 --> 00:41:50,208
No, Aunty. It's not really a gang.
It's more like...

652
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:52,625
Squad, guys.

653
00:41:52,708 --> 00:41:54,416
-No.
-No, it's not.

654
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,916
-Study group!
-Too tacky.

655
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,125
Community.

656
00:41:58,208 --> 00:41:59,583
That's too outdated, guys!

657
00:41:59,666 --> 00:42:01,916
-Gang is better.
-I agree, gang.

658
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,416
-Squad!
-Gang is better.

659
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,583
-Yes.
-Enough!

660
00:42:08,541 --> 00:42:11,500
As long as you live in this house,

661
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:15,791
you have to follow my rules, and Amri's.
That's it.

662
00:42:15,875 --> 00:42:17,708
I'm butting out of this!

663
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,083
Well then, I am moving out
from this house.

664
00:42:28,541 --> 00:42:30,250
I don't want to be restrained.

665
00:42:30,916 --> 00:42:32,583
Yes, gang? Am I right?

666
00:42:32,666 --> 00:42:34,500
Aselole!

667
00:42:34,583 --> 00:42:37,125
-Yes.
-Aselole! Aselole!

668
00:42:59,958 --> 00:43:04,750
Anna, I'll come by tomorrow
to pack my belongings.

669
00:43:04,833 --> 00:43:06,583
Why not now? We'll wait for you.

670
00:43:06,666 --> 00:43:07,791
Tomorrow, it is.

671
00:43:08,166 --> 00:43:09,750
Now is not a good time.

672
00:43:09,833 --> 00:43:11,375
Ibu Anna is still mad.

673
00:43:11,458 --> 00:43:13,125
It's cooler like this anyway.

674
00:43:13,208 --> 00:43:16,041
Leaving like the good guys in movies.

675
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:19,875
You heard them. See you tomorrow.

676
00:43:34,791 --> 00:43:39,458
So, Lastri will be more independent now.

677
00:43:48,458 --> 00:43:52,791
-Come on, Lastri. Come on!
-Watch out!

678
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:54,541
Careful.

679
00:44:37,375 --> 00:44:40,875
The writing is too small. I can't read it.

680
00:44:44,333 --> 00:44:46,208
It's switched off again. Come on, Mom!

681
00:44:58,666 --> 00:45:00,833
Amri!

682
00:45:00,916 --> 00:45:02,333
Mom, where are you going?

683
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:05,041
Come home, Mom!

684
00:45:06,416 --> 00:45:08,750
Anna misses you.

685
00:45:09,291 --> 00:45:10,541
And so do I.

686
00:45:23,541 --> 00:45:25,541
This is the moment of truth.

687
00:45:26,791 --> 00:45:29,458
We will find out our GPAÂ 
for this semester.

688
00:45:29,541 --> 00:45:31,583
Let's do it together. One...

689
00:45:33,125 --> 00:45:34,333
Two...

690
00:45:34,416 --> 00:45:35,250
Three.

691
00:45:41,625 --> 00:45:44,541
Don't call it out just yet.
We'll wait for Lastri.

692
00:45:51,291 --> 00:45:52,333
Wow.

693
00:45:56,125 --> 00:45:58,541
Lastri in the house, guys!

694
00:45:58,625 --> 00:46:01,208
Thank God!

695
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:06,625
My prayers are answered! I got 1.3!

696
00:46:16,708 --> 00:46:19,166
What's yours?

697
00:46:20,083 --> 00:46:21,208
I got 2.7.

698
00:46:22,166 --> 00:46:23,791
Mine is 2.5, guys.

699
00:46:24,583 --> 00:46:25,666
I got 2.8.

700
00:46:26,208 --> 00:46:28,750
I got 3.9.

701
00:46:29,416 --> 00:46:32,250
-That's so high.
-One point three!

702
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:36,500
I am the stupidest!

703
00:46:39,875 --> 00:46:43,333
I will be kicked out by Chaerul.

704
00:46:48,833 --> 00:46:50,000
Lastri, it's okay.

705
00:46:58,166 --> 00:46:59,291
I have an idea.

706
00:47:00,208 --> 00:47:03,000
We're going to voodoo that puffer fish.

707
00:47:03,083 --> 00:47:05,333
No. Not that extreme.

708
00:47:08,375 --> 00:47:11,791
We're going to make him attracted to you.

709
00:47:13,708 --> 00:47:15,791
No. Out of the question.

710
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,708
-No.
-Lastri.

711
00:47:18,791 --> 00:47:20,958
This is so you won't be expelled.

712
00:47:23,166 --> 00:47:25,166
He is lonely.

713
00:47:26,541 --> 00:47:30,250
A widower. Divorced ten years ago.

714
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,333
Because his wife was sane enough.

715
00:47:36,083 --> 00:47:40,541
Who wants to marry a hater like him?

716
00:47:42,041 --> 00:47:44,583
Lastri, you know the term "hater"?

717
00:47:44,666 --> 00:47:47,125
Well, she likes doing
Instagram live with me.

718
00:47:47,458 --> 00:47:49,041
Ugh!

719
00:47:49,541 --> 00:47:51,583
That's not important. Let's focus.

720
00:47:52,291 --> 00:47:54,375
Today Lastri, Sarah, and I,

721
00:47:54,458 --> 00:47:56,708
are going to do a social experiment.

722
00:47:56,791 --> 00:48:01,625
We're going to test out if men can still
be tricked by women's looks.

723
00:48:01,708 --> 00:48:04,333
Since men are more visual beings,

724
00:48:04,416 --> 00:48:07,208
looks really matter.

725
00:48:07,291 --> 00:48:08,208
That's not me.

726
00:48:10,625 --> 00:48:11,750
This suits you best.

727
00:48:23,458 --> 00:48:27,541
Our dean likes a woman

728
00:48:27,625 --> 00:48:30,416
who is graceful and a bit arrogant.

729
00:48:30,833 --> 00:48:33,833
How do you know so much about him?

730
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:41,416
Honorable, Mr. Dean...

731
00:48:42,125 --> 00:48:44,625
Just use his name, don't use his title.

732
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:47,625
Mr. Chaerul.

733
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:50,916
Don't be too formal.

734
00:48:51,708 --> 00:48:53,041
Bro Chaerul.

735
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,708
You're Lastri, right?

736
00:48:57,291 --> 00:49:00,291
Don't panic, stay relaxed. Chill.

737
00:49:00,666 --> 00:49:02,416
Yes, Bro.

738
00:49:03,791 --> 00:49:06,500
Here's the thing, Bro.

739
00:49:06,583 --> 00:49:09,208
I need to talk to you.

740
00:49:09,708 --> 00:49:10,875
Are you free?

741
00:49:10,958 --> 00:49:16,083
He won't resist an invitation
to a fancy restaurant.

742
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:19,833
Flamboyan is a fancy restaurant.

743
00:49:20,333 --> 00:49:24,125
Especially if it's on you. Free meal.

744
00:49:24,458 --> 00:49:25,791
Your treat, okay?

745
00:49:26,833 --> 00:49:29,333
Remember, be arrogant.

746
00:49:34,083 --> 00:49:37,625
Money is not a problem, Bro.

747
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:40,166
Don't act like you don't have any, Bro.

748
00:49:40,708 --> 00:49:41,875
What do you say?

749
00:49:42,166 --> 00:49:43,041
All right, then.

750
00:49:47,541 --> 00:49:49,041
Okay, then.

751
00:50:17,916 --> 00:50:21,208
You seem very hungry.

752
00:50:22,083 --> 00:50:24,625
I might order more dishes.

753
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:43,958
Yes, sure.

754
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:45,833
Welcome, Sir.

755
00:50:48,666 --> 00:50:50,166
Not too many.

756
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:51,666
Okay.

757
00:50:52,458 --> 00:50:55,375
-I want black coffee.
-Okay.

758
00:50:55,458 --> 00:50:56,708
And...

759
00:50:56,958 --> 00:50:58,458
Some fruit.

760
00:50:58,541 --> 00:50:59,500
Okay.

761
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,375
So...

762
00:51:11,625 --> 00:51:15,500
What's the reason for this invitation?

763
00:51:18,291 --> 00:51:21,583
Just tell the truth.

764
00:51:21,666 --> 00:51:23,250
Be honest.

765
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:27,708
Because he is arrogant, definitely.

766
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,875
Undoubtedly stubborn.

767
00:51:30,666 --> 00:51:32,750
Egotistical, needless to say.

768
00:51:33,583 --> 00:51:35,875
But dad doesn't like liars.

769
00:51:40,541 --> 00:51:44,708
I knew it!

770
00:51:54,916 --> 00:51:56,208
Well...

771
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:04,416
My GPA this semester was awful.

772
00:52:05,791 --> 00:52:07,791
I beg you, please...

773
00:52:09,083 --> 00:52:10,666
Don't expel me.

774
00:52:11,375 --> 00:52:14,791
Give me a chance to make things right.

775
00:52:16,291 --> 00:52:20,791
Why do I have to give you a chance?

776
00:52:39,708 --> 00:52:40,791
Riyanti...

777
00:52:43,041 --> 00:52:45,583
My only grandchild.

778
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,833
She had a dream.

779
00:52:50,416 --> 00:52:56,166
She wanted to go to college in Europe
majoring in communications.

780
00:52:57,666 --> 00:53:00,625
She studied every night and day.

781
00:53:14,083 --> 00:53:15,375
And finally...

782
00:53:17,666 --> 00:53:19,666
She received a scholarship.

783
00:53:24,166 --> 00:53:25,250
But...

784
00:53:27,666 --> 00:53:30,333
She got into an accident and passed away.

785
00:53:34,625 --> 00:53:35,708
I don't know.

786
00:53:38,708 --> 00:53:44,166
Did God love her so much
that He took her away or maybe...

787
00:53:45,708 --> 00:53:47,791
God hates me.

788
00:53:49,541 --> 00:53:50,833
That I...

789
00:53:52,666 --> 00:53:55,375
Had to bury my own grandchild.

790
00:54:01,666 --> 00:54:05,708
But I'm still not ready
to bury her dreams.

791
00:54:10,708 --> 00:54:14,375
You should be realistic.

792
00:54:15,041 --> 00:54:18,791
If you're not able...

793
00:54:20,083 --> 00:54:23,583
But I am. Give me a chance.

794
00:54:26,708 --> 00:54:28,166
What if...

795
00:54:29,708 --> 00:54:31,333
your GPA is still awful?

796
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,583
I'll kick myself out.

797
00:54:43,708 --> 00:54:44,750
Okay, then.

798
00:54:47,708 --> 00:54:49,583
But, under one condition.

799
00:54:53,458 --> 00:54:55,708
If you want more dishes,
I can't pay for them.

800
00:54:55,791 --> 00:54:59,708
-No. Not that.
-What?

801
00:54:59,791 --> 00:55:03,083
I'd like to...

802
00:55:03,541 --> 00:55:06,416
invite you to dinner tomorrow.

803
00:55:08,041 --> 00:55:10,000
That's it? Yes.

804
00:55:13,083 --> 00:55:16,791
Yesterday,
I took you to a fancy restaurant.

805
00:55:17,416 --> 00:55:20,250
Yet, you take me to place like this.

806
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:24,708
I'm all dressed up for a place like this.

807
00:55:24,791 --> 00:55:27,791
But it's good, right?

808
00:55:27,875 --> 00:55:30,000
The tempeh is good.

809
00:56:04,416 --> 00:56:05,833
You were there until evening?

810
00:56:08,666 --> 00:56:10,958
Besides being arrogant, he's also cheap?

811
00:56:11,541 --> 00:56:13,166
Such a sly bureaucrat.

812
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:17,208
He's definitely arrogant.

813
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:22,500
He is definitely cheap.

814
00:56:23,125 --> 00:56:25,833
He is also definitely a bureaucrat.

815
00:56:28,541 --> 00:56:29,708
But...

816
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,125
Mr. Chaerul is not sly.

817
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:40,000
You sound so in love.

818
00:56:41,208 --> 00:56:46,500
-Oh, my God. That can't be happening.
-Lastri, so how did it go?

819
00:56:47,625 --> 00:56:49,000
Are you expelled?

820
00:56:50,416 --> 00:56:52,625
I got a second chance!

821
00:56:57,083 --> 00:56:58,791
I have to hurry to class.

822
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:01,500
I have plans this evening with Chaerul.

823
00:57:01,583 --> 00:57:03,375
Dinner at a fancy restaurant.

824
00:57:07,291 --> 00:57:09,833
If this were a movie,
this would be a plot twist.

825
00:57:10,208 --> 00:57:13,666
Instead of unfollowing the Dean,
she is subscribing to him instead .

826
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:17,041
-What's going on?
-Okay then. I'm off as well.

827
00:57:17,583 --> 00:57:18,916
Where to? We have class.

828
00:57:19,541 --> 00:57:20,958
I need to do something.

829
00:57:21,041 --> 00:57:22,833
I'll catch up with you later.

830
00:57:30,666 --> 00:57:32,208
Sarah! Erfan!

831
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:49,458
As mentioned in the first point,
journalism is fundamentally...

832
00:57:49,541 --> 00:57:51,625
delivering the truth.

833
00:57:51,708 --> 00:57:55,625
That's the difference
between journalism and hoax.

834
00:57:55,958 --> 00:58:00,208
Journalism is also committed
to the masses.

835
00:58:00,291 --> 00:58:03,000
-Yes?
-Pardon me, Sir.

836
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:07,708
Shouldn't class be over at 4 p.m.?

837
00:58:07,791 --> 00:58:10,666
Because I have an appointment at 6 p.m.

838
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:12,458
Well, it's only 5 p.m.

839
00:58:13,291 --> 00:58:15,875
Well, I have to get ready and dress up.

840
00:58:16,666 --> 00:58:18,166
You're right.

841
00:58:19,291 --> 00:58:21,500
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

842
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:23,791
So, may I?

843
00:58:24,208 --> 00:58:25,416
Of course...

844
00:58:25,833 --> 00:58:28,958
not. Wait until I'm finished.

845
00:58:30,458 --> 00:58:31,333
Oh, you!

846
00:58:31,416 --> 00:58:34,916
Yes, all of you.
Describe the points above.

847
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,791
Lastri, do you want
to jump out the window?

848
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:42,875
Danny.

849
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,875
Lastri wants to jump out of the window.

850
00:58:46,958 --> 00:58:48,083
Okay, then.

851
00:59:03,291 --> 00:59:04,333
Hey!

852
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:06,791
Are you running away?

853
00:59:09,291 --> 00:59:11,625
Do you not realize
we're on the third floor?

854
00:59:15,666 --> 00:59:17,416
Shall we continue, guys?

855
00:59:21,125 --> 00:59:22,083
Come in.

856
00:59:24,541 --> 00:59:25,791
Good afternoon, Sir.

857
00:59:33,125 --> 00:59:34,208
Come in.

858
00:59:35,541 --> 00:59:36,791
Come in.

859
00:59:44,875 --> 00:59:46,083
What happened?

860
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:51,416
Regarding your instruction
at the beginning of this semester.

861
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:55,875
If Lastri acts up,

862
00:59:56,458 --> 00:59:59,500
I am supposed to take her directly to you.

863
00:59:59,875 --> 01:00:01,750
So, here she is.

864
01:00:02,291 --> 01:00:04,541
Yes. So, what happened?

865
01:00:05,625 --> 01:00:08,708
She attempted to run away
through the window.

866
01:00:08,791 --> 01:00:10,083
From the third floor.

867
01:00:13,833 --> 01:00:17,333
Through the window? That's pretty extreme.

868
01:00:19,708 --> 01:00:22,291
The class was supposed
to be over at 4 p.m., Sir.

869
01:00:23,333 --> 01:00:26,458
But Mr. Fahmi extended his lecture.

870
01:00:26,541 --> 01:00:30,708
Meanwhile, I have plans
with a special person.

871
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:35,458
But that is my right as a lecturer, Sir.

872
01:00:35,541 --> 01:00:40,000
Are you asking me to cancel my plans
with this special someone?

873
01:00:41,583 --> 01:00:43,083
You're too much.

874
01:00:43,791 --> 01:00:46,208
There's no such thing as a special person.

875
01:00:47,291 --> 01:00:49,666
But there is a special martabak, though.

876
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:51,458
A person can't be special.

877
01:00:51,541 --> 01:00:52,625
Why not?

878
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,791
There are many special people.

879
01:00:56,583 --> 01:00:58,208
You act like you know a lot.

880
01:00:58,291 --> 01:01:02,041
What I mean is the use of the word
"special" here is...

881
01:01:02,708 --> 01:01:03,958
Quiet, please?

882
01:01:07,958 --> 01:01:10,833
You may go home now.

883
01:01:14,375 --> 01:01:18,541
Thank you, Sir. I can't wait
to meet that special someone.

884
01:01:19,083 --> 01:01:20,083
Good luck.

885
01:01:24,791 --> 01:01:26,333
Have fun.

886
01:01:35,583 --> 01:01:37,666
That look on Fahmi's face...

887
01:01:39,875 --> 01:01:42,250
I was also offended.

888
01:01:42,666 --> 01:01:46,666
How come he didn't believe
that I'm a special person?

889
01:01:47,625 --> 01:01:49,500
Yeah. That's how it is.

890
01:01:50,083 --> 01:01:52,541
The problem with people like us.

891
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:54,666
What?

892
01:01:55,041 --> 01:01:57,541
We easily get offended.

893
01:01:58,833 --> 01:02:00,000
It's such a pity.

894
01:02:01,291 --> 01:02:04,708
I pity the people around us.

895
01:02:05,416 --> 01:02:07,208
Pity?

896
01:02:07,916 --> 01:02:12,500
Fahmi is my subordinate.
That's his consequence.

897
01:02:13,708 --> 01:02:16,083
I'm not talking about Fahmi.

898
01:02:17,416 --> 01:02:19,166
It's about your daughter.

899
01:02:22,208 --> 01:02:23,500
You know?

900
01:02:27,791 --> 01:02:32,166
Sarah is trying hard...

901
01:02:32,708 --> 01:02:37,000
so that no one knows I'm her father.

902
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:45,125
Actually, there's a cold war
between Sarah and I.

903
01:02:46,166 --> 01:02:50,916
I just want her to take a proper major.

904
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,375
Instead, she wants to learn about fashion.

905
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:56,083
That's not useful.

906
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:00,750
You know what?

907
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:07,541
There are three photos of you
in Sarah's room.

908
01:03:08,625 --> 01:03:10,500
-Three photos of me?
-Yes.

909
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:13,416
No way!

910
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:20,583
Why does she choose photos
over her real father?

911
01:03:21,875 --> 01:03:26,416
Well, because your photos are not stubborn

912
01:03:27,208 --> 01:03:28,458
and annoying.

913
01:04:33,708 --> 01:04:34,833
Dad.

914
01:04:50,333 --> 01:04:51,750
Have a seat, Dad.

915
01:05:32,708 --> 01:05:34,750
I was tidying up our house.

916
01:05:35,375 --> 01:05:40,750
Then I found your childhood photos.

917
01:05:41,958 --> 01:05:43,166
You were so cute!

918
01:05:44,708 --> 01:05:50,166
I wanted to put your photos
in my workplace.

919
01:05:54,208 --> 01:05:58,458
You don't need to worry.
No one will recognize you.

920
01:05:58,875 --> 01:06:01,416
You were still a baby in those photos.

921
01:06:04,708 --> 01:06:05,791
Yeah, sure.

922
01:06:06,708 --> 01:06:10,291
But, would you like to...

923
01:06:11,125 --> 01:06:14,583
put my photo in your bedroom?

924
01:06:15,708 --> 01:06:16,791
So, we're even!

925
01:06:17,125 --> 01:06:18,625
No! What for?

926
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:21,458
Why? Are you ashamed of being my daughter?

927
01:06:21,541 --> 01:06:24,291
No. It's not because I feel ashamed.

928
01:06:24,708 --> 01:06:26,083
Then why?

929
01:06:27,958 --> 01:06:29,875
Because you're annoying, Dad.

930
01:06:34,666 --> 01:06:35,666
Why are you laughing?

931
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:41,375
I've heard that phrase twice today.

932
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:44,583
Who's the other person who said that?

933
01:06:46,125 --> 01:06:47,375
That Old Hag.

934
01:06:54,333 --> 01:06:56,083
Guys, I'm so happy

935
01:06:56,166 --> 01:07:00,666
because it's my first timeÂ 
going to a night club.

936
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:05,250
Discotheque and karaoke.
Can you guess where am I?

937
01:07:05,333 --> 01:07:08,333
Asolole. I'm so excited.

938
01:07:08,416 --> 01:07:12,375
-I'm going to...
-Dan, I want to address your followers.

939
01:07:12,458 --> 01:07:14,000
Okay. Gladly, guys.

940
01:07:14,083 --> 01:07:14,958
What's the name?

941
01:07:15,041 --> 01:07:16,750
Baladanny.

942
01:07:16,833 --> 01:07:19,250
You're all stupid!

943
01:07:19,333 --> 01:07:20,291
What's wrong, guys?

944
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:26,166
Dan, do you understand
the meaning of guys?

945
01:07:26,833 --> 01:07:31,125
I'm here alone.
Guys is for plural. Get it?

946
01:07:31,708 --> 01:07:33,583
Nice info, guys. Asolole.

947
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:39,125
Being friends with a former
boy band is so hard.

948
01:07:41,791 --> 01:07:43,208
Come in, please.

949
01:07:44,541 --> 01:07:46,333
VIP room, guys.

950
01:07:51,125 --> 01:07:56,375
The first hour is 150,000 rupiah,
excluding food and drinks. 

951
01:07:56,791 --> 01:07:57,625
For an additional--

952
01:07:57,708 --> 01:08:00,708
Sir, is there a girl named Reva here?

953
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,125
If I'm not mistaken, I saw her here.

954
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:06,458
She's a Berdosa like us.

955
01:08:07,541 --> 01:08:10,416
Son, we all sin.

956
01:08:11,083 --> 01:08:13,291
But if we mean it,

957
01:08:13,375 --> 01:08:17,291
Insha Allah,
the gate of repentance will open.

958
01:08:18,333 --> 01:08:19,666
Oh, my!

959
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:21,791
Sir,

960
01:08:22,291 --> 01:08:25,000
I want a karaoke companion

961
01:08:25,291 --> 01:08:27,791
who can be my date. Do you have one?

962
01:08:27,875 --> 01:08:30,666
Oh, my God!

963
01:08:31,083 --> 01:08:33,458
We just talked about repentance.

964
01:08:40,375 --> 01:08:46,000
Thank you for your good influence
towards my daughter.

965
01:08:47,875 --> 01:08:53,375
Sarah is already a good girl
before she met me.

966
01:08:53,750 --> 01:08:57,000
You're the one who taught
your daughter to be a good person.

967
01:08:57,375 --> 01:09:00,583
Sometimes your mouth

968
01:09:01,166 --> 01:09:04,916
can be sweet. Sometimes bitter.

969
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:08,166
-My mouth is not coffee.
-That's right.

970
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:11,708
Both your mouth and coffee
give people insomnia.

971
01:09:13,291 --> 01:09:14,541
Sweet talker.

972
01:09:15,625 --> 01:09:17,458
Such sweet talk!

973
01:09:20,958 --> 01:09:23,791
I'm serious.

974
01:09:24,833 --> 01:09:28,416
I want to spend time with you
again tomorrow.

975
01:09:32,416 --> 01:09:36,458
Food addiction? You're greedy.

976
01:09:36,541 --> 01:09:37,541
No, I'm not.

977
01:09:37,625 --> 01:09:40,208
-Then what?
-Dance addiction.

978
01:09:40,291 --> 01:09:43,875
You can dance by yourself.

979
01:09:43,958 --> 01:09:49,208
I can't.
How can I dance without a partner?

980
01:09:50,916 --> 01:09:52,125
What do you say?

981
01:09:55,708 --> 01:09:58,666
Okay. Tomorrow, right?

982
01:10:07,166 --> 01:10:11,666
Your favorite lecturer is calling me.

983
01:10:13,083 --> 01:10:14,208
Fahmi.

984
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:18,750
Hello?

985
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:20,958
What's going on?

986
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:25,500
WhatsApp link chat?

987
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,416
About what? Okay, wait a minute.

988
01:10:30,250 --> 01:10:31,458
-Yes.
-Open the door.

989
01:10:31,541 --> 01:10:33,458
Hi, ladies. Come in.

990
01:10:33,541 --> 01:10:36,875
This is Yolanda, this is Baby.

991
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:41,208
-This is Mawar and this is Angela.
-Hi.

992
01:10:41,291 --> 01:10:42,291
Enjoy.

993
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:49,250
I think I know her, guys.

994
01:10:50,958 --> 01:10:51,833
Reva.

995
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:57,291
Wait. Angela!

996
01:10:57,375 --> 01:11:01,541
Guys, Lastri is having a makeover.

997
01:11:01,625 --> 01:11:03,083
She's really into it.

998
01:11:03,375 --> 01:11:07,666
Be careful, Lastri.
You might end up liking him.

999
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:11,333
God forbid! I don't like that puffer fish!

1000
01:11:11,416 --> 01:11:14,000
If it weren't for the grade,
I wouldn't do it!

1001
01:11:23,416 --> 01:11:26,625
Hey! So, is this the reason

1002
01:11:27,125 --> 01:11:29,125
you're always sleepy?

1003
01:11:29,541 --> 01:11:31,375
What do you care?

1004
01:11:34,541 --> 01:11:37,750
What I do is none of your business!

1005
01:11:39,875 --> 01:11:41,833
You consider this a job?

1006
01:11:43,333 --> 01:11:44,958
I thought you weren't stupid.

1007
01:11:45,416 --> 01:11:48,958
-Not that stupid?
-Yes. You're smart!

1008
01:11:49,416 --> 01:11:51,208
You're stupid for choosing this job.

1009
01:11:53,333 --> 01:11:55,583
What do you know about this job?

1010
01:11:56,291 --> 01:11:57,875
You don't know, do you?

1011
01:11:57,958 --> 01:12:01,583
Do you know how it feels

1012
01:12:02,083 --> 01:12:03,666
doing this job every day?

1013
01:12:04,208 --> 01:12:05,500
You don't know!

1014
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,041
Just get out. I have a job to do.

1015
01:12:13,708 --> 01:12:15,250
Don't disturb me anymore!

1016
01:12:19,583 --> 01:12:22,041
You want to do your job?

1017
01:12:22,125 --> 01:12:23,666
You want to do your job?

1018
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:29,208
Take this 100,000 rupiah! Go home now.

1019
01:12:29,541 --> 01:12:32,958
You've got your money for tonight.

1020
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,125
You got what you wanted.

1021
01:12:40,875 --> 01:12:42,583
Oh, God! She slapped him.

1022
01:12:47,458 --> 01:12:50,833
I told you to go! Go!

1023
01:12:55,666 --> 01:12:57,708
Get away from here now!

1024
01:13:12,083 --> 01:13:14,583
Amazing! This is good, guys!

1025
01:13:14,666 --> 01:13:16,416
Be sensitive, jerk!

1026
01:13:17,083 --> 01:13:19,708
I still have to pay installments
on that phone, guys!

1027
01:13:33,166 --> 01:13:34,916
Chaerul, wait.

1028
01:13:35,791 --> 01:13:38,125
Wait. Let me explain.

1029
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:40,458
Let me explain.

1030
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:44,791
From now on, stay away from my daughter.

1031
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,125
I pity you.

1032
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:51,041
Pity?

1033
01:13:54,333 --> 01:13:55,458
Pity?

1034
01:13:57,500 --> 01:14:00,875
Are you God? Don't be like a saint!

1035
01:14:01,291 --> 01:14:04,541
God doesn't pity me and my grandchild!

1036
01:14:05,458 --> 01:14:08,041
She doesn't need pity. She's gone.

1037
01:14:08,333 --> 01:14:10,666
They're happy wherever they are.

1038
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:15,750
You need to pity yourself
and your daughter who are left behind.

1039
01:14:16,041 --> 01:14:18,416
My daughter and I are fine.

1040
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:19,708
Are you sure?

1041
01:14:23,916 --> 01:14:28,708
This is the real world, Lastri,
not a fairy tale.

1042
01:14:29,041 --> 01:14:30,875
So, "everything is fine" is impossible.

1043
01:14:32,458 --> 01:14:36,083
Starting tomorrow, don't come to class.

1044
01:16:25,958 --> 01:16:26,958
Reva!

1045
01:16:30,541 --> 01:16:32,375
You have a letter from the Dean.

1046
01:17:12,208 --> 01:17:15,708
YOU ARE REQUIRED TO ATTEND
STUDENT ETHICS SUMMON

1047
01:17:15,791 --> 01:17:18,041
BECAUSE YOUR ATTITUDE
DISGRACES OUR REPUTATION

1048
01:17:47,458 --> 01:17:49,583
Riyanti!

1049
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:12,791
We have to accept this sincerely.

1050
01:18:14,041 --> 01:18:15,250
We have to.

1051
01:18:29,833 --> 01:18:31,083
You guys know?

1052
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:34,291
Yes, guys.

1053
01:18:48,875 --> 01:18:52,291
Lastri, I will talk to my father.

1054
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,958
You don't need to. This is my fault.

1055
01:19:03,083 --> 01:19:04,250
No.

1056
01:19:06,708 --> 01:19:07,833
We need to protest.

1057
01:19:08,541 --> 01:19:10,291
Don't do that, Fan.

1058
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:13,208
This is my problem.

1059
01:19:13,916 --> 01:19:16,875
Don't make it everyone's problem.

1060
01:19:19,916 --> 01:19:22,083
Guys, if we make this issue viral...

1061
01:19:22,166 --> 01:19:23,833
This is because of you!

1062
01:19:24,083 --> 01:19:26,083
Why is it because of me, guys?

1063
01:19:26,958 --> 01:19:28,916
Stop it.

1064
01:19:33,583 --> 01:19:36,500
Hey. Where's Reva?

1065
01:19:51,250 --> 01:19:56,000
-Reva, come down!
-Come down, Reva.

1066
01:19:56,083 --> 01:20:00,041
Come down!

1067
01:20:03,541 --> 01:20:07,708
-Reva, come down!
-Come on, come down!

1068
01:20:14,875 --> 01:20:17,625
-Reva!
-Reva, come down!

1069
01:20:20,666 --> 01:20:25,125
-Move, guys!
-Make way!

1070
01:20:25,208 --> 01:20:28,833
-Reva!
-Oh, my God!

1071
01:20:28,916 --> 01:20:31,000
Reva, what are you doing?

1072
01:20:31,083 --> 01:20:33,083
-Reva!
-Reva, come down!

1073
01:20:33,166 --> 01:20:34,875
-Reva!
-Reva, come down!

1074
01:20:34,958 --> 01:20:35,958
Reva!

1075
01:20:36,916 --> 01:20:37,791
Reva, come down!

1076
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:39,333
What's wrong?

1077
01:20:39,416 --> 01:20:43,791
What's happening?
Do any of you know what's happening?

1078
01:20:43,875 --> 01:20:45,083
I don't know, guys.

1079
01:20:46,333 --> 01:20:47,250
Tell her!

1080
01:20:47,333 --> 01:20:48,541
Why me, guys?

1081
01:20:49,083 --> 01:20:52,416
Reva and Lastri's issues
are because of your social media!

1082
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:54,666
I was just telling the truth.

1083
01:20:55,583 --> 01:20:58,041
Baladannies deserves to know this.
I'm doing God's work here.

1084
01:20:58,125 --> 01:21:01,083
You're not a journalist.
You're just overacting to become famous!

1085
01:21:02,041 --> 01:21:04,291
-I'm overacting?
-Yes, you're overacting.

1086
01:21:04,375 --> 01:21:08,958
Who do you think you are? An activist?
You're easily triggered.

1087
01:21:09,041 --> 01:21:11,708
You act like you're the best.

1088
01:21:11,791 --> 01:21:12,666
Stop it!

1089
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:14,791
-Don't get mad at me, guys!
-So what?

1090
01:21:14,875 --> 01:21:17,500
-I'm not afraid of you!
-Enough! Stop it!

1091
01:21:17,583 --> 01:21:18,750
Why are you fighting?

1092
01:21:19,166 --> 01:21:22,291
Look, she's in danger. You go up there!

1093
01:21:22,375 --> 01:21:23,416
Go there!

1094
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:25,708
Why me?

1095
01:21:25,791 --> 01:21:27,625
You can do it, guys!

1096
01:21:28,708 --> 01:21:29,958
Reva!

1097
01:21:30,041 --> 01:21:32,333
Reva!

1098
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:34,625
-Be careful!
-Be careful, Fan!

1099
01:21:34,916 --> 01:21:37,166
-Guys!
-Reva!

1100
01:21:37,250 --> 01:21:38,791
Be careful.

1101
01:21:39,750 --> 01:21:40,708
Shit!

1102
01:21:43,083 --> 01:21:45,041
Shit!

1103
01:21:47,166 --> 01:21:48,208
What are you doing here?

1104
01:21:48,291 --> 01:21:50,791
What about you? Don't ask me.

1105
01:21:50,875 --> 01:21:52,750
Bismillah.

1106
01:21:52,833 --> 01:21:55,791
I hope Erfan can convince Reva.

1107
01:21:56,708 --> 01:21:59,333
If you want to jump, then do it.
Don't make a drama.

1108
01:21:59,625 --> 01:22:01,250
Who wants to jump?

1109
01:22:02,750 --> 01:22:04,916
So what are you doing here?

1110
01:22:05,333 --> 01:22:08,000
I needed a quiet place to think.

1111
01:22:08,875 --> 01:22:10,166
A quiet place?

1112
01:22:11,958 --> 01:22:14,208
Ever tried going to the cemetery
at midnight?

1113
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,083
Are you crazy?

1114
01:22:17,916 --> 01:22:20,291
Why would you consider this tower
a quiet place?

1115
01:22:20,708 --> 01:22:22,250
You're making my life very hard.

1116
01:22:23,541 --> 01:22:26,958
Hard? What do you know about a hard life?

1117
01:22:27,041 --> 01:22:29,375
-You come from a rich family.
-Hey!

1118
01:22:29,458 --> 01:22:31,958
Don't ever think rich people
have a happy life.

1119
01:22:33,916 --> 01:22:36,125
Do you want to know how hard my life is?

1120
01:22:36,791 --> 01:22:37,708
Listen.

1121
01:22:38,958 --> 01:22:42,000
Me and my mother just found out
my father has a second wife.

1122
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:44,875
I never knew who my father was,
since I was kid.

1123
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:51,333
My father married a girl my age.

1124
01:22:51,958 --> 01:22:54,166
And she was my ex-girlfriend.

1125
01:22:55,125 --> 01:22:59,375
So, my ex is my step-mother.

1126
01:22:59,458 --> 01:23:01,500
Can you imagine?
My life is like a soap opera.

1127
01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:05,041
My mom was a gudeg seller.

1128
01:23:05,333 --> 01:23:09,375
She fell in love with an Italian tourist
and he dumped her when she was pregnant.

1129
01:23:09,791 --> 01:23:13,750
She was so heartbroken, she passed away.
Now I live alone.

1130
01:23:15,625 --> 01:23:17,833
Oh, my God!

1131
01:23:17,916 --> 01:23:18,958
My mother...

1132
01:23:21,916 --> 01:23:24,750
Okay, you win.
Your soap opera is better than mine.

1133
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:25,875
Exactly.

1134
01:23:26,708 --> 01:23:29,291
Like a tormented movie. Oh, my God!

1135
01:23:32,166 --> 01:23:33,083
Rev.

1136
01:23:34,708 --> 01:23:37,750
Sorry, because of my carelessness
and Danny's...

1137
01:23:38,666 --> 01:23:40,958
Everyone knows your job.

1138
01:23:44,041 --> 01:23:46,875
I know how to take care of myself
doing those kinds of jobs.

1139
01:23:48,291 --> 01:23:52,041
Not everyone who works those
kinds of jobs are easy girls.

1140
01:23:52,125 --> 01:23:54,166
Reva, come down!

1141
01:23:55,666 --> 01:24:00,041
Miss Reva! Mr. Erfan!

1142
01:24:00,708 --> 01:24:04,041
Please come down! This is an order!

1143
01:24:04,416 --> 01:24:09,666
If there are casualties
due to your stupid actions,

1144
01:24:10,166 --> 01:24:13,875
the reputation of our college will suffer.

1145
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:16,541
Let's have a bit of fun.

1146
01:24:17,166 --> 01:24:18,166
How?

1147
01:24:18,541 --> 01:24:23,541
Miss Reva! Mr. Erfan! Please come down!

1148
01:24:25,166 --> 01:24:26,208
Sir!

1149
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,166
Reva wants to jump.

1150
01:24:28,250 --> 01:24:32,458
Don't do that! Come down!

1151
01:24:32,541 --> 01:24:35,041
Don't jump, guys!

1152
01:24:35,125 --> 01:24:37,583
Don't jump!

1153
01:24:38,208 --> 01:24:41,666
Every problem can be solved.

1154
01:24:41,750 --> 01:24:45,375
Don't worry. Tell me your problem.

1155
01:24:45,833 --> 01:24:47,208
What's your problem?

1156
01:24:47,291 --> 01:24:49,041
Why put eye drops in?

1157
01:24:53,541 --> 01:24:55,416
Oh, my God.

1158
01:24:56,666 --> 01:24:59,666
This life is so cruel.

1159
01:24:59,750 --> 01:25:02,458
I can't bear it anymore.

1160
01:25:02,541 --> 01:25:05,500
-Mr. Erfan.
-I will jump right now!

1161
01:25:05,583 --> 01:25:09,833
-Don't! Reva!
-Don't jump, guys!

1162
01:25:09,916 --> 01:25:11,208
Hey!

1163
01:25:11,291 --> 01:25:12,875
Oh, my God! Reva!

1164
01:25:12,958 --> 01:25:15,750
You guys down there,
don't attempt to catch me.

1165
01:25:15,833 --> 01:25:16,833
What do you mean?

1166
01:25:17,333 --> 01:25:19,333
Let my body break into pieces.

1167
01:25:20,375 --> 01:25:23,500
Let my head crack and my brain scatter.

1168
01:25:24,541 --> 01:25:28,708
My intestines splatter,
and my kidneys crush. Let it be!

1169
01:25:30,041 --> 01:25:32,375
Enough. You sound so stupid.

1170
01:25:35,250 --> 01:25:38,666
Don't jump. I'll help you.

1171
01:25:38,750 --> 01:25:40,625
I'll help solve your problem.

1172
01:25:42,541 --> 01:25:43,750
What's your problem?

1173
01:25:44,291 --> 01:25:45,250
Say it.

1174
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:51,375
Sir, please don't expel me and Lastri.

1175
01:25:52,750 --> 01:25:55,375
Is that it?

1176
01:26:02,708 --> 01:26:04,958
-Say it.
-Okay.

1177
01:26:06,291 --> 01:26:07,708
One more thing, Sir.

1178
01:26:07,791 --> 01:26:09,750
What else?

1179
01:26:11,125 --> 01:26:13,666
Get rid of spontaneous quizzes.

1180
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,208
I agree, guys!

1181
01:26:15,291 --> 01:26:18,750
Fine, just get down.
I'll see what I can do.

1182
01:26:18,833 --> 01:26:21,208
Now come down. Hurry!

1183
01:26:23,166 --> 01:26:24,291
Asolole!

1184
01:26:24,375 --> 01:26:26,125
Asolole, guys.

1185
01:26:27,125 --> 01:26:30,208
Asolole!

1186
01:26:31,916 --> 01:26:33,791
Guys, come down.

1187
01:26:36,083 --> 01:26:38,541
-Thank God!
-My jargon, guys. Asolole!

1188
01:26:38,625 --> 01:26:41,083
Asolole. Come down, guys.

1189
01:26:41,166 --> 01:26:44,625
It's hot up there. Hurry.

1190
01:26:44,708 --> 01:26:46,750
My jargon, guys.

1191
01:27:08,458 --> 01:27:10,333
Mr. Dean, could I...

1192
01:27:10,833 --> 01:27:13,708
have an audience?

1193
01:27:14,208 --> 01:27:15,916
Don't call him Mr. Dean.

1194
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,666
Don't call him Mr. Dean, guys.

1195
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:20,333
Guys, I also wanna listen.

1196
01:27:21,250 --> 01:27:23,333
Can I, Mr. Chaerul?

1197
01:27:24,875 --> 01:27:28,208
Why don't you ask your media team
to come in?

1198
01:27:30,750 --> 01:27:32,958
Let them stay outside.

1199
01:27:33,041 --> 01:27:35,916
What do you want from me?

1200
01:27:36,833 --> 01:27:38,375
Lastri wants to apologize, Dad.

1201
01:27:54,041 --> 01:27:55,291
I'm sorry.

1202
01:27:55,958 --> 01:27:58,875
Say it. Hurry.

1203
01:28:00,375 --> 01:28:04,208
I didn't mean to hurt you.

1204
01:28:06,708 --> 01:28:08,083
Heartache?

1205
01:28:09,625 --> 01:28:11,083
I'm a divorcee.

1206
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:14,458
I'm divorced and I have a daughter

1207
01:28:14,958 --> 01:28:18,666
who left the house.

1208
01:28:19,875 --> 01:28:23,583
She doesn't want anyone to know
that I'm her father.

1209
01:28:25,375 --> 01:28:28,958
I'm a heartbreak master.

1210
01:28:36,208 --> 01:28:38,166
I'm an old widow.

1211
01:28:40,166 --> 01:28:42,666
My husband passed away.

1212
01:28:46,375 --> 01:28:49,208
My only granddaughter...

1213
01:28:50,166 --> 01:28:51,875
passed away.

1214
01:28:55,125 --> 01:28:56,666
My son-in-law...

1215
01:28:57,416 --> 01:29:01,375
snores loudly.

1216
01:29:03,125 --> 01:29:05,708
Well, I too

1217
01:29:06,291 --> 01:29:08,750
am a heartbreak master.

1218
01:29:13,291 --> 01:29:14,416
So?

1219
01:29:15,958 --> 01:29:17,666
Now we know

1220
01:29:18,750 --> 01:29:20,291
each other's feelings,

1221
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:24,583
what do you want, then?

1222
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,416
Remind you of your promise.

1223
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:33,250
Promise?

1224
01:29:34,625 --> 01:29:35,750
What promise?

1225
01:29:37,291 --> 01:29:40,125
You invited me to a dance...

1226
01:29:40,708 --> 01:29:41,875
tonight.

1227
01:29:43,458 --> 01:29:47,666
How dare you ask me to dance?

1228
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:49,250
I'm still angry.

1229
01:29:50,208 --> 01:29:52,041
What if I reject your request?

1230
01:29:53,708 --> 01:29:56,083
I'm a heartbreak master, did you forget?

1231
01:29:57,708 --> 01:29:58,666
Huh.

1232
01:30:05,625 --> 01:30:07,333
What are you doing?

1233
01:30:08,375 --> 01:30:10,625
I can't hear them. Shut up!

1234
01:30:12,875 --> 01:30:14,416
What if...

1235
01:30:15,958 --> 01:30:19,541
What if I accepted your request?

1236
01:30:20,875 --> 01:30:22,166
What would the song be?

1237
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,333
What's wrong with your hands?

1238
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,166
Music, please!

1239
01:30:39,250 --> 01:30:40,375
Play the music.

1240
01:30:46,916 --> 01:30:48,500
What song is that?

1241
01:30:50,125 --> 01:30:51,250
What?

1242
01:30:51,958 --> 01:30:52,833
Is that?

1243
01:30:52,916 --> 01:30:55,958
I don't know, guys.
Turn off my phone, guys.

1244
01:31:03,541 --> 01:31:05,000
Oh, God!

1245
01:31:25,333 --> 01:31:28,000
My name is Lastri.

1246
01:31:28,083 --> 01:31:31,500
This is the ending of my story.

1247
01:31:32,541 --> 01:31:37,458
UNIVERSITY CYBER INDONESIA

1248
01:31:37,916 --> 01:31:38,916
Riyanti.

1249
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,750
BORN 10 FEBRUARY 2001
DIED 21 MAY 2019

1250
01:31:42,083 --> 01:31:43,791
Your grandmother has done it.

1251
01:31:46,916 --> 01:31:47,958
Riyanti,

1252
01:31:48,541 --> 01:31:53,333
we promise we'll take careÂ 
of Lastri until she graduates.

1253
01:31:53,791 --> 01:31:56,250
At this age...

1254
01:31:56,833 --> 01:32:01,291
there are so many new things
that I don't know,

1255
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,083
which I can still learn.

1256
01:32:07,375 --> 01:32:13,500
I learned that losing someone
isn't a reason to stop.

1257
01:32:15,625 --> 01:32:21,958
But losing someone is a reason
to keep moving on.

1258
01:32:22,041 --> 01:32:23,750
Dancing.

1259
01:32:24,333 --> 01:32:26,791
Because one day...

1260
01:32:27,208 --> 01:32:29,750
The song will stop.

1261
01:32:30,291 --> 01:32:35,375
So, enjoy it as long as you can.

1262
01:32:35,458 --> 01:32:37,041
Come on!

1263
01:33:04,291 --> 01:33:07,000
Next time, be careful who you prank.

1264
01:33:07,083 --> 01:33:08,250
She's elderly.

1265
01:33:08,333 --> 01:33:10,375
Sorry, it was unintentional, guys.

1266
01:33:10,458 --> 01:33:13,708
Help her. One, two, three.

1267
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,750
One, two, three.

1268
01:33:19,250 --> 01:33:23,166
-Failed.
-Try again.

1269
01:33:23,250 --> 01:33:24,958
You go up there. Tell her to come down.

1270
01:33:25,041 --> 01:33:27,958
I'm afraid of heights.
I don't want to fall from there.

1271
01:33:28,041 --> 01:33:29,791
You have health insurance.

1272
01:33:29,875 --> 01:33:33,125
That's not useful.

1273
01:33:33,208 --> 01:33:37,625
Well, if you fall and die...

1274
01:33:37,708 --> 01:33:40,541
You'll die as a martyr.
You'll go to heaven.

1275
01:33:40,625 --> 01:33:45,458
I'm moving out...

1276
01:33:45,541 --> 01:33:48,625
I can't... I'm sorry.

1277
01:33:49,208 --> 01:33:52,250
You just woke...

1278
01:33:52,833 --> 01:33:58,500
Grandma is asking... Grandmother?

1279
01:33:58,583 --> 01:34:03,208
Riyanti, my granddaughter...

1280
01:34:05,750 --> 01:34:06,875
It's not working.

1281
01:34:07,833 --> 01:34:11,166
So...

1282
01:34:11,250 --> 01:34:12,500
Oh, God!

1283
01:34:12,583 --> 01:34:14,583
Let's go, guys.

1284
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:21,541
Thank you, Amri.

1285
01:34:21,625 --> 01:34:23,666
-Assalamualaikum.
-Wa'alaikumsalam.

1286
01:34:32,375 --> 01:34:34,708
-What's wrong?
-It's stuck.

1287
01:34:34,791 --> 01:34:36,333
I will drive your car.
