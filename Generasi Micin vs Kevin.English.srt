1
00:00:11,916 --> 00:00:13,791
This is my dad, Choi Cho-jin,

2
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:15,250
also known as Tyo Anggara.

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,000
And this was his aspiration.

4
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:24,375
When will you pay your debts?

5
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:25,291
I have no money.

6
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:28,833
That's the wrong concept in Indonesia,
you send a debt collector to poor people,

7
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:30,416
even the boss pays a visit.

8
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:32,791
Poor people should receive charity,
not threats.

9
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:37,333
So can I borrow some more?

10
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:46,416
That's what he wanted to be.

11
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:48,083
But he ended up like this.

12
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:50,458
"Those who are afraid to ask,
speak the loudest."

13
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:53,541
Sir, lower the price some more.

14
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:55,708
I brought my own sack.

15
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:56,625
No way!

16
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:58,208
It's lower than the buying price.

17
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:00,250
You can take it or leave it.

18
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:03,166
Dad didn't finish his school

19
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,833
but learned trading at the market.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So that's how you do it?

21
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:08,041
Do you buy it now, and then sell it
during Eid al-Fitr?

22
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:09,208
-With an increased price?
-Yes.

23
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:11,750
It's cheaper when you buy it now.

24
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:13,666
But it's more expensive
when you buy it later.

25
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,125
A merchant has to be smart

26
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:16,375
to gain more profit.

27
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:19,166
Gradually, Dad learned how to make dough.

28
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:22,625
Lower the price some more.

29
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:23,666
I brought my own sack.

30
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,791
Gosh!

31
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:26,583
"A frog trapped in ice."

32
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:28,333
It's lower than the buying price.

33
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:30,375
Finally, Dad made his dream come true.

34
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:31,375
To have his own store.

35
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:32,833
-Come on.
-No way!

36
00:01:32,916 --> 00:01:34,333
-I'm a regular customer.
-No!

37
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:36,166
He kept collecting money.

38
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,625
Well done. You solved everything.

39
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:43,083
Yeni is such a smart student.

40
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:45,541
This is my mom, Yeni Huang.

41
00:01:45,625 --> 00:01:47,625
Before she became Yeni Anggara, of course.

42
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:52,291
Forget it. Stop thinking about school.

43
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:53,916
I don't have the money.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,250
You should take a sewing course.

45
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,666
-How much?
-One hundred.

46
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,083
What?

47
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:03,208
Did I hear you right?

48
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:04,541
Your price is too high!

49
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,333
How can rice be that pricey?

50
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:07,666
This is a difficult time.

51
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,458
Prices are going up. We're in a crisis.

52
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:11,083
Lower the price a little.

53
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:12,791
Please?

54
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,875
Let's make it 50.

55
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,083
Until Dad realized

56
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:20,666
that there was another kind of profit.

57
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:24,416
I'll tell you what.
I'm not lowering the price.

58
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,291
But I'll deliver this to your house.

59
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:27,250
To your doorstep.

60
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:30,625
To our house.

61
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:40,041
That sack he delivered
brought them closer.

62
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,416
This was the old generation.

63
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:43,500
Where you could gain a new friend
with just a sack.

64
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:44,958
Let's take pictures.

65
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:47,333
Perhaps since they both
couldn't finish school,

66
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:48,875
they ended up getting married.

67
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:52,583
For dowry, Dad promised Mom
a house plus a shop or a shophouse.

68
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:54,291
-The most luxurious one in Jakarta.
-Smile!

69
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:55,375
Look happy!

70
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:56,958
Let me take a shot. This is good.

71
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:58,625
One, two... Goodness!

72
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,833
Ma'am, stop shaking their hands!

73
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,958
Hurry! I'm running out of film!

74
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,083
Hey, man!

75
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:06,541
Look happier!

76
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:07,666
That's good.

77
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,916
Ready? Goodness!

78
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Miss!

79
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,291
Can't you see I'm working here?

80
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,333
Ma'am, stop shaking their hands!

81
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:16,833
Come on, look happy!

82
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:17,916
Yes, good!

83
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:20,750
Oh, gosh!

84
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:22,583
Damn! These people.

85
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,458
Okay, get ready. Look this way.

86
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,916
One, two...

87
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:30,000
One is a merchant,
while the other is good at math.

88
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,666
To fulfill his dream of becoming
a successful businessman,

89
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,750
they both agreed to put off having a baby.

90
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,416
Hey, Trisno, what are you doing?

91
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:40,083
His name is Huang Ang Jing.

92
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,708
The person I call A Shu.

93
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:43,458
Which means "Uncle", not something else.

94
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,583
PERFORMING ART FESTIVAL
HARAPAN BUANA HIGH SCHOOL

95
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:49,041
A Shu is the most "rock and roll" person
I've ever known.

96
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:51,666
It's like he never thinks of
anything else, even college or work.

97
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:59,416
He belongs to a generation
that grew up in the Reformation Era.

98
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,583
He's a cool guy, but...

99
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,041
See for yourself.

100
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,333
Quiet down!

101
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:09,833
Just stop singing!

102
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,416
Go run the store with your brother!

103
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,916
Your life will have more meaning!

104
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,000
Yes, okay, Ms. Dor!

105
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:18,875
Your voice is hideous!

106
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,125
-All right!
-All right!

107
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:22,208
Get lost!

108
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,750
For years, the luxurious shop
was still out of reach.

109
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:26,125
But Mom got pregnant anyway.

110
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:27,041
It's like this, sir.

111
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:29,458
Your baby's position is not normal.
We need to do a C-section.

112
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:30,375
A C-section?

113
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:31,291
What?

114
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:32,500
A C-section, ma'am.

115
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,666
-What?
-A C-section!

116
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,916
Oh, inflation.

117
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,500
She's inflated because she is pregnant.
What's with this doctor?

118
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:41,333
Doctor, a C-section requires
a lot of extra money.

119
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:43,750
Goodness! No need!
I can still hold it, Doctor.

120
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:46,000
See, Doctor? My wife can still hold it.

121
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:48,583
I truly believe that your wife
can still hold it.

122
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:49,500
Yes, Doctor.

123
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:50,666
But I can't.

124
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,916
-What?
-What's wrong, Doctor?

125
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,500
If anything happens to your baby,
I will be responsible.

126
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,041
I can't stand to pay compensation.

127
00:04:56,375 --> 00:05:00,625
-Doctor, can't you lower the price?
-Then I'll give you a second opinion.

128
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:01,875
Okay, tell us, Doctor.

129
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,666
We'll use a local suture thread.

130
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,208
What? Local?

131
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:07,000
What do you mean by a vocal lesson?

132
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,166
-Honey.
-What?

133
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,791
Local thread. Not a vocal lesson.

134
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,125
I see.

135
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,916
-There's one condition.
-What is it, Doctor?

136
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,208
She has to stitch it herself.

137
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:18,625
What? Goodness, Doctor!
I've never taken a sewing class!

138
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:22,083
I've told you to take a sewing course
and you refused!

139
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,291
We're not sewing shirts here!

140
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:25,500
Enough, it's not that.

141
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,291
Doctor, please lower the price some more.

142
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:30,083
-Look. Listen to me carefully.
-Yes.

143
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,500
-I will lower the price.
-Yes!

144
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,250
-There's one condition.
-What is that?

145
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,000
Impregnate your wife once again.

146
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:37,333
Come back here. I'll be your doctor again.

147
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:39,416
Deal?

148
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,166
-All right?
-Goodness!

149
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,333
-Right, thank you.
-Is he serious?

150
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:47,375
An ear, nose, and throat specialist
is next door.

151
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:49,583
Affordable! There's no need to haggle!

152
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:50,500
Excuse me.

153
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,583
Hurry up, please!

154
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,166
What did he say?

155
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,333
Get pregnant again!

156
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:58,250
What?

157
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,583
Your father-in-law can't do it anymore!

158
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,708
Not you! Our daughter!

159
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,208
-Hurry up, honey!
-Okay!

160
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:06,666
After fierce bargaining,

161
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,666
finally, I was born
with a C-section procedure.

162
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:13,416
Why is my grandson so quiet?
I can't hear his sound.

163
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,166
He's crying now, Mom.

164
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,333
Now what? Is there another problem?

165
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,916
It's like this, Doctor.
I want to give him an Indonesian name.

166
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:29,625
My father-in-law wants a Chinese name.
So that people will know his heritage.

167
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,833
But we were all born in Indonesia.

168
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,333
You all made a fuss about payment.

169
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:36,875
Now you're making a fuss
about free stuff like giving a name?

170
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:37,916
I'll name him.

171
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,833
-What?
-What?

172
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:40,416
-Do you have one?
-Of course.

173
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:41,750
Chuan Kee.

174
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,083
-What?
-Chuan Kee?

175
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,375
That's another Chinese name.

176
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,041
That's a food's name.

177
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,083
I'm just kidding.

178
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,083
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

179
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,208
Please forgive me.

180
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,625
Hey, what did he say?

181
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:54,958
Forgiven.

182
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,916
That's a good name, Kevin!

183
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:00,333
That doctor is smart.

184
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:01,750
Kevin?

185
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,083
Kevin Anggara, that's my name
on my birth certificate.

186
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:07,041
Born in the 2000s, people say
I belong to Generation Z.

187
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,166
Even more annoying than millennials.

188
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,125
They call us the MSG Generation.

189
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,250
That hurts! What's this?

190
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,416
MSG GENERATION? EASY GENERATION!

191
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,416
You cowards! All you do is criticize!

192
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,666
Hi!

193
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:21,750
-Vin, come down here!
-I will!

194
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,333
Eat first!

195
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:24,541
This is my brother.

196
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,583
He was born out of my dad's promise
to the doctor.

197
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,583
Honey, call your son.

198
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:29,500
Hey, watch it!

199
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:32,083
Vin, come down here! Eat first.

200
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:33,375
Later!

201
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:36,291
Hey, Vin, you know what?
I got this from my WhatsApp group.

202
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:39,916
Playing too many games
will make you stupid!

203
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,416
Ane gong!

204
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,416
I agree, Yeni.

205
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:46,750
Vin! Your mom got this
from her WhatsApp group.

206
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,958
Playing too many games
will make you stupid!

207
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,166
Ane gong.

208
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:52,250
Vin!

209
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,500
Why isn't this kid coming down?

210
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:58,083
Hey, come down here! Hurry!

211
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,583
Okay, all right!

212
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,333
Sir, I've brought everything down.

213
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:09,291
Hey, not all of them!

214
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,750
My son's not coming down yet!

215
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:14,750
No, honey.
We're unloading Haji Imron's bags order.

216
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:16,750
-Vin!
-Yes!

217
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:18,083
I'm hungry!

218
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm not hungry yet.

219
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,625
You should stop playing games.

220
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,666
Sir, do you have that thing?

221
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,666
What thing?

222
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,250
You know, usually...

223
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,333
When I make a delivery,
I get that thing...

224
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:33,916
Oh, right.

225
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,416
I gave it to your boss.

226
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,125
So I don't get anything?

227
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,125
I've settled it already.
I even gave him some extra.

228
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,250
-Well then. Later, sir.
-Thanks.

229
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,083
I even rode a motorcycle here,
instead of walking.

230
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,000
Let's go, dear.

231
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:48,000
-Ready?
-Yes.

232
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:48,916
Good.

233
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:49,916
Come.

234
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,250
-Let's have a good meal once in a while.
-Yes!

235
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,291
Tend to the store seriously.

236
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,125
Don't close it too soon.

237
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:59,166
Sometimes housewives come late at night
to buy sewing threads.

238
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,750
-There's no such thing.
-Hurry, honey.

239
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:01,833
This is Dad's shophouse.

240
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,833
But this is not what my mom dreamed of.

241
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,500
Tyo, you look so handsome.

242
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:08,750
Where are you going?

243
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:12,000
I've been handsome for a long time.

244
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,333
That's why I'm dressed up like this.

245
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,416
We're going to a wedding
at Haji Imron's place.

246
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,666
I see.

247
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:22,000
Yeni, look at these eggs
I just bought from you!

248
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,375
I broke one and a chick came out!

249
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,166
Impossible!

250
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,125
I inspect my eggs every day!

251
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,416
I'm sure they're good!

252
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,541
You didn't buy them here!

253
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,916
Where else did I buy them?
I want compensation!

254
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,166
-Impossible!
-Come on, dear. Just give it to her.

255
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,000
People say customers are king.

256
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,458
Moreover, she's our neighbor.
Just give it to her.

257
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:43,041
Great! A little compliment
gives you a big head.

258
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,333
When will you buy me a shophouse
at Pantai Indah Kapuk

259
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:46,666
if we keep giving compensation?

260
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,291
Come on, stop yelling.

261
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,791
The neighbors are listening. Enough.

262
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:53,541
Trisno, please compensate her.

263
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:56,083
-Yes, brother.
-Let's go now.

264
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:57,416
That habit of yours!

265
00:10:58,416 --> 00:10:59,458
-Thank you, Tyo!
-Yes.

266
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:00,416
Give her three less.

267
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,416
Yes, Yeni.

268
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,583
What is it, miss?

269
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,500
Here, replace them all.
I bought one kilogram.

270
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,500
One kilogram? Are you mugging us?

271
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:08,416
It's true!

272
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:11,541
Tomorrow is a school day,
and I've come back to the routine.

273
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,000
Dad, Mom, I'm leaving.

274
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:15,916
Okay.

275
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,500
-Hey, study hard!
-I will.

276
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:21,041
Honey, tell your son to study hard.

277
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,750
Study hard, Vin.

278
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:23,666
I will!

279
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,333
Tell him not to chat too much.

280
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,083
Don't chat too much, Vin.

281
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:30,125
We paid good money for your tuition.
And all you do is play!

282
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,000
We paid good money for your tuition,
and all you do is play!

283
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:36,083
Honey, you shouldn't have repeated
that part! I was talking to myself!

284
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,000
-Really!
-Yes, I knew that.

285
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,166
No problem.

286
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,916
Dad, Mom, I'm leaving.

287
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
-Okay!
-Okay, take care!

288
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,833
Vin!

289
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,250
This is Chelsea. My childhood friend.

290
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,750
How about it? Are you excited?

291
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:51,250
What? What's happening?

292
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:54,333
What's with you?
This is our first and last day--

293
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:57,000
You mean our first day of school
in our last year of school?

294
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,250
Yes, that's what I meant.

295
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:00,166
So how is it? What do you prepare?

296
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,250
Nothing, the usual.

297
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,416
We're not like freshmen
who have to prepare everything.

298
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,916
What's with you?
At least prepare something.

299
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,125
Morning, Ms. Chelsea, Mr. Kevin.

300
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:10,208
Morning, sir. We're over here.

301
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,208
Sorry.

302
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,666
-Okay then, sir.
-Stay in school, okay?

303
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,916
Don't use your tuition money for drugs.

304
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:18,916
Or those needle things.

305
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,833
Or...

306
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:21,000
Like that.

307
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:22,500
Take care!

308
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,750
I believe you'll be awarded
the best speaker this year.

309
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:25,791
For the English debate?

310
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,500
Wish me luck. This is my last chance.

311
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,000
I did. My guesses are always right.

312
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,041
Chelsea's a smart girl.

313
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,083
She never uses subtitles
while watching western movies.

314
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,500
Her childhood dream
is to become an ambassador.

315
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,875
I hope by the end of the year

316
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,833
I can get closer to her.

317
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:39,083
Morning, sir.

318
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,208
Wait! Who are you?

319
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:42,166
A teacher.

320
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,208
A teacher?

321
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:44,125
Yes.

322
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:45,166
A temporary one.

323
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,166
Oh, a temporary teacher?

324
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,166
-Are you new?
-Yes.

325
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,458
-Please go inside, sir.
-Okay.

326
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:50,833
Chelsea!

327
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:53,208
Bon-bon?

328
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,833
Goodness, I miss you so much!

329
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:58,541
-Chelsea!
-Hi, Bon!

330
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:00,208
How was your holiday?

331
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:01,166
Yes, it was fun.

332
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:02,666
This is Bon-Bon, my friend.

333
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,333
He actually knows a lot of things.

334
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:05,416
But well...

335
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,000
Did you guys see my Instagram story?

336
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,500
That's not how you spell Sydney.

337
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,333
Nobody reminded me, Kev.

338
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,083
I have gifts for you two.

339
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:15,708
Really? It's weird for you to remember.

340
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:21,250
Gosh, how cute, Bon. Thanks.

341
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:25,416
What's this?

342
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,916
That's candy with...

343
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:28,250
Koala poop flavor.

344
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,750
It's the tastiest
and it's a best-seller at the store.

345
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,291
It's fine. Maybe it's delicious.

346
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:34,875
Right. Thank you.

347
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,250
Okay. Let's go inside.

348
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,166
Come on.

349
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,083
While I was there,
I really missed Indonesian food.

350
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,833
-True, Indonesian food.
-Of course.

351
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,583
Padang rice, chicken satay.

352
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,166
Awesome.

353
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,500
I'm going to my class. Okay?

354
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:49,833
-Bye.
-Bye, Chel.

355
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,000
Hi, Jo.

356
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,208
-Hi, Chels.
-Bye.

357
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,500
Johana!

358
00:13:58,708 --> 00:13:59,583
So?

359
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,000
This is Johana. Her voice is loud.

360
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,083
But that doesn't mean she's mean.

361
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,166
She's useful to Bon-bon.

362
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:09,333
Where's the gift for me?

363
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,416
Oh, right. I forgot. I'm sorry.

364
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,583
What's with you?
I reminded you, but you forgot me!

365
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:17,416
I know. Tomorrow, okay?

366
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,625
You're all talk!

367
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:20,750
Hey, Vin. Where's the Old Guy?

368
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,916
Last time I saw him
unboxing Blackpink's new cassette,

369
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,416
staring at Park Seung-il's photos,
covered SNSD's music video,

370
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,833
and got burnt from eating Samyang.

371
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,500
I forgot to tell you something.

372
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:30,416
When I'm suddenly asked like this

373
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,833
my mind just pours out.

374
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:33,291
Remind me.

375
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,333
Isn't "samyang" the Korean word
for "pooping"?

376
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:39,000
Samyang is when you know someone

377
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:40,583
you will "samyang."

378
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,416
That's "sayang." I know that one.

379
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,333
Friends!

380
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,625
Did you miss Dimas oppa?

381
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:50,750
This is the one they call "Old Guy."

382
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:51,666
His name is Dimas.

383
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,958
But he prefers to be called "oppa."

384
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,083
-Dimas!
-Dimas!

385
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,000
How are you?

386
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,625
Dimas Prasetya.

387
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:02,583
Here.

388
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,333
Your names are difficult.
I can't memorize them.

389
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,125
Johana?

390
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,083
Here, sir.

391
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:09,375
Kevin?

392
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:10,291
Yes.

393
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:11,291
Bon-Bon?

394
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:12,458
Here, sir.

395
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:15,333
I just don't understand this class.

396
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,583
Of all students, only the four of you
are interested in science class.

397
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,916
As the school treasurer,

398
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,500
I sometimes wonder.

399
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,833
Why can't you just move
to the social class?

400
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,833
We can cut the budget.

401
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,500
Moreover, we just recently

402
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,500
recruited a new temporary teacher.

403
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,333
Hey, you.

404
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:34,583
The smart one. Please answer.

405
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,583
I think if we are transferred
to the social class,

406
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:39,083
this class will be empty
and occupied by scary creatures

407
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,250
that can be used
by Indonesian producers in movies

408
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:42,833
to rule the box office in Indonesia.

409
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:45,625
If that's the case, our cinemas
will be filled with horror movies, sir.

410
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,666
Why are we talking about horror movies?

411
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,333
Of course not, sir.
We just chose to be in science class.

412
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:52,291
Right, guys?

413
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:53,375
-That's right!
-That's right!

414
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,666
Hey, remind me.

415
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,041
What movie are we watching after school?

416
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:58,958
-Kafir!
-Kafir!

417
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,250
Hey! Watch your language.

418
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:01,500
People might get offended.

419
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,833
Attention!

420
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:14,583
This is an important announcement.

421
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,583
I ask that all school activities

422
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,416
be ceased for the time being.

423
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,750
We haven't even started.

424
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:27,583
Right now, we are preparing
the prerequisites

425
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:30,416
for very important activity.

426
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,333
Which is...

427
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,083
"Super Student Cup."

428
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:37,666
And it will be held at our school.

429
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:43,541
I have also made an encouraging poster.

430
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:47,875
Which will be posted all over our school.

431
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:49,625
Thank you.

432
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,500
-Sir!
-Kafir!

433
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:01,750
In this new school year,
I will take your attendance.

434
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,083
Sir, you already did.

435
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,041
No, I didn't.

436
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,458
Aldo's channel keeps gaining followers.

437
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,333
He did this over the holiday.

438
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,666
His ketoprak unboxing video
became trending!

439
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,083
I know. That ketoprak unboxing
that he didn't even buy?

440
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,500
That video was no fun, Dim.

441
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:31,458
You better watch Uncle Hotman on holiday
In Bali.

442
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,500
Wait a minute. Remind me.

443
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:35,166
Is it Aldo or Hotman?

444
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,333
Aldo!

445
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:38,666
Hey!

446
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:40,791
Aldo?

447
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,583
If you keep bringing lunch boxes,

448
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,000
Mrs. Nia will be out of business.

449
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,000
Jo, remind me. Who is Mrs. Nia?

450
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,666
That's my part.

451
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,750
Who is Mrs. Nia?

452
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:53,875
Jo, remind me. Who is Mrs. Nia?

453
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,000
Our cafeteria lady!

454
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:56,500
Cafeteria lady, Mas.

455
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:59,291
Ma'am! Are you bankrupt?

456
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:00,458
Not yet.

457
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:01,625
Not yet.

458
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:06,791
Vin.

459
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:09,166
What are you doing?

460
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,333
Are you deaf? What are you doing?

461
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:20,125
When I'm wearing a headset,
that means I don't want to be disturbed.

462
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,166
Hey.

463
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:23,916
Is this your friend?

464
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,083
His channel has a lot of cute girls.

465
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,625
Yes, Aldo.

466
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,458
Finally, someone from our school
got famous.

467
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:33,500
If you put it that way,

468
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,625
some of our alumni became ministers.

469
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,916
Someone from last year's class won
the World Accounting Olympics.

470
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,833
Sheesh, Vin, I mean a real famous person.

471
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:42,916
A celebrity!

472
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,916
A YouTube celebrity?
Makes good vlogs, made into memes.

473
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,500
I mean someone who creates work, Vin!

474
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:50,916
This Aldo creates something.

475
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,750
Better than you,
playing games all the time.

476
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,750
No, Kev, let's have dinner!

477
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:56,750
On the way!

478
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:59,583
-Vin, your mom is calling!
-Just a second!

479
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,333
She'll be furious, then you'll get it.

480
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:03,000
Vin!

481
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:06,083
Viewers, the hoax spreading

482
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,125
is threatening our nation's unity.

483
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,500
-We're here.
-Hey, No.

484
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,375
Isn't that your friend?

485
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:17,000
The singer Syahrini is reported
to have suffered fractures

486
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:19,333
when she performed
her pretty back and forth moves.

487
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,916
Yes, brother.

488
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,000
Do you still talk about that?

489
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:27,333
Hey, Vin. Why is it so hard for me
to call you down for a meal?

490
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,791
You know my childhood was difficult.

491
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:30,833
We were poor!

492
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:33,250
We split one scrambled egg
for ten people, Vin!

493
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:37,166
I've been making meals like this every
day. And you're still not eating much!

494
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,750
The usual. When MSG Boy
sits in front of his computer

495
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,250
it will be hard to move him.

496
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:44,291
Hey! Excuse me?
I don't use MSG in my cooking.

497
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:45,916
Don't misunderstand, Yeni.

498
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,166
I'm not talking about MSG for food.

499
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,625
It's about Kevin's generation,
they want everything quick.

500
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,208
Everything is instant!

501
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,500
Well, he's not from your generation.

502
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,416
Your generation is a late bloomer.

503
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,000
-Late to get a job.
-Why me?

504
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:01,750
Late to get a girl, late to get married.
Everything's expired.

505
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:05,333
Why am I the target?

506
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,166
This is why I don't like being at home.
They call me lazy, MSG kid.

507
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,083
They don't even understand my world.

508
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,791
-Come on, let's eat.
-Let's eat.

509
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,833
Eat well.

510
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:25,125
Do your kicks at the futsal court.

511
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,625
What are you doing there?

512
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,250
Watching the moon?

513
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:33,166
There's nothing there.

514
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,333
Right there.

515
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:39,916
Why are you writing
while watching the moon?

516
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:41,791
Jakarta's moon is obstructed by smoke.

517
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:44,333
Give me a break, Vin.
I'm comfortable that way.

518
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,000
Just like you have to poop at home.

519
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:50,333
You know how uneasy it is for me
to sit where strangers' butts have been.

520
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:51,750
Don't be strangers then.

521
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,083
-Sir.
-Hi, sir.

522
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,166
Hi, sir, miss.

523
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,250
Let's not be strangers.

524
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:05,625
Hey, Vin. By the way...

525
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:07,666
You don't write blogs anymore, do you?

526
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:10,000
Your last post was two years ago.

527
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,000
Well, it's just like when you were a kid.

528
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:14,083
You couldn't sleep
until you listened to Joshua's songs.

529
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,166
Why don't you listen
to Joshua's songs anymore?

530
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,625
-Corny.
-There you go. Same with me.

531
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,541
-What was that, sir?
-Just a thief, sir.

532
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:31,666
Why aren't you chasing him?

533
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,583
According to the law,
my jurisdiction is from here to there.

534
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:37,500
The 03 Neighborhood Watch jurisdiction.

535
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:40,416
From here to there
is the 04 Neighborhood Watch jurisdiction.

536
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,166
Where did the thief go?

537
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,208
-To the 04.
-There you go.

538
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,583
But we just saw a security guard
chasing from 03 to 04.

539
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:49,083
That's Christopher,
he lives outside the law.

540
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:51,333
Okay then, sir, miss.

541
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:53,708
Carry on with your rendezvous.

542
00:21:58,208 --> 00:21:59,208
LET'S HANG OUT. BRING KEVIN.

543
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:00,583
Dimas is asking us out. Come on.

544
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:16,416
There he is. Come on.

545
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,333
Dim!

546
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:22,916
Dimas.

547
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:25,291
-Hey, Chels, Kev!
-Hey!

548
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:26,208
Look!

549
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:28,833
World record! I'm so awesome!

550
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,000
I'll suggest you
to an Indonesian Record Museum.

551
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,541
What's with you, Vin? That was cool.

552
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:33,541
Thank you.

553
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:35,166
I thought we were going somewhere else.

554
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:37,500
I've told you.

555
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:38,791
This place is the most fun.

556
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:41,041
Can't you see my crowd? Make some noise!

557
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:44,500
Hey, by the way...

558
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:45,833
You guys should try this game.

559
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:47,166
-No!
-No, it's fine!

560
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,583
It's all right. Just a minute.

561
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:50,875
Noobs, really sorry.

562
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:53,208
But I don't think you'll be using
these machines tonight.

563
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:55,208
All these machines can only be used by me

564
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:56,541
and my guests.

565
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,666
Sheesh, uncle!

566
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,916
Take turns!

567
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:01,666
Did you call me "uncle"?

568
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:03,416
Call me...

569
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:05,333
Dimas oppa.

570
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:08,250
-Come on. Dimas oppa.
-Dimas oppa!

571
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:09,250
That's good.

572
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:11,500
Come on, oppa. It's our turn.

573
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:14,416
-Yes, Dim. We're leaving as well.
-No, it's all right.

574
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,416
Hey, cracker bits! Let me tell you,
I know all your shame, your sins!

575
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,541
Do you want me to report you?

576
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:21,208
Hey! You kid!

577
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:23,583
I know you always come here
when you skip classes!

578
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:26,250
You kid! I know you like to extort
your friends' money!

579
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:27,500
You kid...

580
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,500
You're not even a kid!
What are you doing here? Go home!

581
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:36,083
I'll report you!

582
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,250
What? You dare?

583
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:40,416
Friends,

584
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,000
the machines are ready. Let's go.

585
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:44,083
Vin, they're vacant.

586
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:45,916
Let's try them. It might be fun.

587
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,083
That's my girl!

588
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:51,375
Chel, are you serious? This corny game?
It's embarrassing.

589
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:54,666
What do you mean it's corny?
You were never fun.

590
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:57,083
Fine, I'll try this game. Watch me, okay?

591
00:23:57,333 --> 00:23:58,500
-Come on, Dim.
-Chel, let's go.

592
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:00,500
-Watch me, Vin!
-Come on!

593
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:01,750
-How to play?
-Try this song.

594
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:04,916
It seems that they're having fun.
But not for me.

595
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,916
-Here.
-Okay. Vin.

596
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,833
Follow the song. One, two...

597
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:10,000
Move your feet like this.

598
00:24:11,916 --> 00:24:12,750
Dim, just a second.

599
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:13,666
-Vin!
-Yes.

600
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,250
Vin, why did you leave?

601
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:20,583
-It wasn't fun.
-Yes, it was.

602
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:24,250
Chel, nowadays, we play games in our room.
On our phones and laptops.

603
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:27,000
But that's not the point.
What's important is playing together.

604
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,000
I also play games together
with other people.

605
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:30,333
But you don't see them directly.

606
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:32,125
The point is I'm not alone.

607
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,833
You've never been fun.

608
00:24:34,916 --> 00:24:36,166
-It's like that.
-Sir.

609
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:38,000
Yes, sir, miss.

610
00:24:38,416 --> 00:24:39,750
Did you have a date?

611
00:24:40,416 --> 00:24:41,250
It's Aldo.

612
00:24:41,833 --> 00:24:42,666
Hello, Do.

613
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:44,750
We're going out tomorrow, right?

614
00:24:45,666 --> 00:24:47,041
Okay. Vin, I'm going inside.

615
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:48,333
-Right.
-Thank you, Vin.

616
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,750
Okay, Do. See you tomorrow.

617
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,083
Aldo.

618
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:57,083
The border between 03 and 04 Neighborhood
is such a fine line.

619
00:24:57,583 --> 00:25:00,250
So if there's a thief running
from there to here,

620
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,416
we only have the right
to chase him up to here.

621
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,583
Do not cross the line.

622
00:25:04,333 --> 00:25:05,583
Do you understand, Christopher?

623
00:25:08,208 --> 00:25:09,875
Why are you shaking your head?

624
00:25:09,958 --> 00:25:11,000
Goodness.

625
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,583
This guy just doesn't get it.

626
00:25:13,166 --> 00:25:14,708
Come on. Let's eat chicken noodles.

627
00:25:14,916 --> 00:25:17,250
The seller is in the 04 Neighborhood.

628
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:19,416
But he's not a thief!

629
00:25:19,833 --> 00:25:22,375
Consume! Eat!

630
00:25:23,416 --> 00:25:26,416
I said "eat", you understand very well!
Let's go!

631
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:31,750
There, you can see it for yourselves.
How boring my final school year is.

632
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:34,333
Accused of being an MSG kid,
having a lame friend,

633
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:36,250
and Chelsea getting closer with Aldo.

634
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:43,833
"Challenges to reaching your dream.

Go on, easy.

00:26:06,708 --> 00:26:08,708
That's it. Hold it.

643
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,416
READY TO HOST THE SUPER STUDENT CUP XX

644
00:26:18,166 --> 00:26:19,583
My poop just went back up.

645
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:22,291
It's Mr. Rustam's face all over.

646
00:26:22,375 --> 00:26:23,916
If I take one down, will he get mad?

647
00:26:27,666 --> 00:26:31,500
The distance between City A and City B

648
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,875
is 3,800 kilometers.

649
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,583
Mr. Margono

650
00:26:37,666 --> 00:26:39,666
filled his gas tank

651
00:26:39,916 --> 00:26:42,500
for 60 liters.

652
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,625
His head fell off!

653
00:26:46,708 --> 00:26:48,708
His head fell off!

654
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,500
Ghost!

655
00:26:52,708 --> 00:26:54,416
You're going to hell, Kev.

656
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,083
Come on, Kevin. Get real.

657
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:58,125
-Here!
-Where?

658
00:26:58,208 --> 00:27:00,208
-Here! This kid, his head fell off!
-Where?

659
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,000
What? No, his head is still there, sir.

660
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,833
Somebody lost his head?

661
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,250
That's right, sir.
Maybe you didn't see it right.

662
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:11,083
This teacher, sometimes he daydreams.

663
00:27:12,041 --> 00:27:14,291
This teacher, sometimes he daydreams.

664
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:16,416
Gosh.

665
00:27:17,291 --> 00:27:19,500
My heart almost stopped.

666
00:27:19,916 --> 00:27:21,166
What should we do?

667
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:23,083
My heart...

668
00:27:23,916 --> 00:27:25,750
Come on, sir. Get some rest.

669
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,083
His heart, dude!

670
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,333
Your prank is lethal, man!

671
00:27:29,416 --> 00:27:30,333
You're insane, Kev.

672
00:27:31,208 --> 00:27:32,916
I'm not looking. His face is so funny.

673
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
With this, I will ask my classmates
to do exciting stuff.

674
00:27:36,416 --> 00:27:38,083
Without them knowing about this website.

675
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:39,500
Marjuki.

676
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:41,166
Temporary Teacher.

677
00:27:45,583 --> 00:27:47,250
What the heck? Why is it green?

678
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:49,666
If I was the headmaster,
it wouldn't be like this.

679
00:27:51,583 --> 00:27:53,625
You know the bureaucracy, right?

680
00:27:54,416 --> 00:27:55,416
Where's the video?

681
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,333
He's mad at the chicken seller?

682
00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:04,250
Oh, he's buying chicken noodles.

683
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,208
-Hi, guys.
-Hi, everyone!

684
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:08,708
Somebody's asking a question.

685
00:28:08,791 --> 00:28:10,500
From Qbayunaughty007.

686
00:28:11,416 --> 00:28:12,333
I remember him well.

687
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:14,083
He's an Aldolisius member from Tangerang.

688
00:28:14,291 --> 00:28:15,416
What are we looking at?

689
00:28:15,666 --> 00:28:16,500
The future.

690
00:28:17,416 --> 00:28:18,250
Be quiet.

691
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:19,166
Trust me.

692
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,416
Lately, there have been

693
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,833
some people inserting letters,

694
00:28:21,916 --> 00:28:23,833
flowers, food, all kinds of stuff
into my locker.

695
00:28:23,916 --> 00:28:25,166
Maybe it was you, Cin?

696
00:28:25,416 --> 00:28:26,500
Will this take long?

697
00:28:26,583 --> 00:28:28,333
I feel like throwing up looking at him!

698
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:29,750
Throw up? Morning sickness?

699
00:28:30,791 --> 00:28:32,208
Perhaps it was you, Chel?

700
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:37,291
-Three, two, one!
-Two, one!

701
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,833
I take it back.

702
00:28:42,916 --> 00:28:45,166
Turns out that the last school year
can be fun.

703
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:47,500
Not just for me,
but for my friends as well.

704
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:53,250
This is out of line, sir.

705
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:54,750
I wouldn't draw you this ugly, sir.

706
00:28:55,708 --> 00:28:56,583
Mr. Tito.

707
00:28:57,458 --> 00:28:59,500
Gather all the teachers in my office.

708
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:01,166
Mr. Juki.

709
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:03,083
Gather all the teachers in my office.

710
00:29:03,166 --> 00:29:05,250
Your office or your office?

711
00:29:05,833 --> 00:29:07,458
I mean the headmaster's office.

712
00:29:07,541 --> 00:29:08,958
I see. Okay, sir.

713
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,166
Where did you find that temporary teacher?

714
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:14,791
Sorry, sir. I found him on the Internet.

715
00:29:16,541 --> 00:29:19,166
Are these all the teachers you can find?

716
00:29:19,666 --> 00:29:22,583
Sorry, sir. But the other teachers have
ongoing classes.

717
00:29:24,166 --> 00:29:25,000
Where's Mr. Bambang?

718
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:28,000
Mr. Bambang has
an overlapping schedule, sir.

719
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:29,166
Overlapping?

720
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,166
He has to go withdraw our salary.

721
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,791
Thank goodness.

722
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,750
Your salary is included.

723
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,250
That's good. All right.

724
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:41,916
Hey, get my mic.

725
00:29:42,833 --> 00:29:44,750
Mr. Juki. Please get my mic.

726
00:29:45,291 --> 00:29:46,541
Your mic or your mic?

727
00:29:47,041 --> 00:29:48,541
I mean Mr. Headmaster's mic.

728
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:53,916
Here you go, sir.

729
00:29:54,708 --> 00:29:56,250
-What is this?
-Your mic, sir.

730
00:29:56,333 --> 00:29:57,333
-Put it there!
-Oh, right.

731
00:29:57,708 --> 00:29:58,916
You amateur!

732
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,916
Next time, don't use an application
to hire a temporary teacher.

733
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:02,916
Yes, sir.

734
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,416
Listen carefully!
Attention to all teachers!

735
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:08,083
The poster at the front gate,

736
00:30:08,958 --> 00:30:10,583
whose picture is that?

737
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:12,250
-Yours.
-Yours.

738
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:15,250
Before it was vandalized, sir.

739
00:30:15,958 --> 00:30:20,958
It is proven that there are so many people
who envy my success!

740
00:30:21,208 --> 00:30:22,541
I ask you all

741
00:30:22,625 --> 00:30:24,166
that poster in front of our school

742
00:30:24,291 --> 00:30:25,916
to be replaced with a new one.

743
00:30:26,333 --> 00:30:27,166
Yes, sir.

744
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,000
What?

745
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,583
Who's going to remind me if nobody's here?

746
00:30:40,791 --> 00:30:41,625
So...

747
00:30:42,458 --> 00:30:43,750
How are things?

748
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:46,500
What about the event's cost?

749
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,416
How about money from Luna, sir?

750
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,041
Right, that's...

751
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:53,916
That goes into my pocket.

752
00:30:55,416 --> 00:30:56,375
Yes.

753
00:30:56,708 --> 00:30:58,958
Soon I will retire.

754
00:30:59,583 --> 00:31:01,333
Where else can I get my income?

755
00:31:02,041 --> 00:31:02,916
Yes.

756
00:31:03,625 --> 00:31:04,666
That can be arranged.

757
00:31:05,833 --> 00:31:07,375
Yes. Right, thank you.

758
00:31:11,916 --> 00:31:12,750
Who's there?

759
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,750
From that phone conversation,
I suspect our headmaster is up to no good.

760
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,250
You shouldn't be prejudiced.
It may become a slander.

761
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,500
Then what was that about?
He talked about money,

762
00:31:26,583 --> 00:31:28,125
retirement, and how it's hard
to get income.

763
00:31:28,333 --> 00:31:30,000
No wonder he's so eager
for this cup event.

764
00:31:30,333 --> 00:31:32,250
-Perhaps...
-Graft.

765
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:34,250
I have to tell this to Uncle Hotman.

766
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:37,625
From now on, we have a new goal.
Exposing dishonesties in this school.

767
00:31:37,708 --> 00:31:39,750
Awesome. Like that movie,
Catatan Akhir Sekolah?

768
00:31:39,833 --> 00:31:42,000
-I'll be Vino G. Bastian.
-What year was that?

769
00:31:42,583 --> 00:31:43,458
Hey!

770
00:31:43,833 --> 00:31:45,083
What are you doing there?

771
00:31:46,666 --> 00:31:47,833
-Are you smoking?
-No!

772
00:31:47,916 --> 00:31:49,250
-What?
-No.

773
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,166
What are you doing?
Science class is that way.

774
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,166
Let's get to know each other. High five.

775
00:31:55,416 --> 00:31:56,416
High five, my foot!

776
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,583
Well, well.

777
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:04,583
A luxurious car delivery.

778
00:32:06,916 --> 00:32:09,000
My students sure are rich.

779
00:32:25,583 --> 00:32:27,416
For goodness sake!

780
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,583
Oh, my. Is that a new car, sir?

781
00:32:30,125 --> 00:32:31,041
Did you buy it online?

782
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:33,083
Make an unboxing video, sir.

783
00:32:36,416 --> 00:32:38,000
Come on, Leo. Let's swim some more.

784
00:32:40,916 --> 00:32:42,750
I sell good eggs, ma'am.

785
00:32:42,833 --> 00:32:45,416
Javanese chicken. They live a happy life.

786
00:32:45,666 --> 00:32:46,583
How much do you want?

787
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:49,166
Yeni, I'm leaving.

788
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,500
You're dressed up nicely for a Saturday.

789
00:32:52,583 --> 00:32:53,666
Where are you going?

790
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,833
The church.

791
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,250
What? Church?

792
00:32:56,416 --> 00:32:57,500
Yes, so what?

793
00:32:57,583 --> 00:32:58,666
Uncle, you converted?

794
00:32:58,916 --> 00:33:02,625
No, Vin.
A friend asked me to sing at her church.

795
00:33:03,166 --> 00:33:04,333
Dad, is that okay?

796
00:33:07,708 --> 00:33:08,916
It's okay.

797
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:10,416
It's all right.

798
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,416
When you help people,
don't discriminate against their religion.

799
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,083
What's important is your good intentions,
don't differentiate people.

800
00:33:16,166 --> 00:33:17,250
You know what they say.

801
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:20,916
Teachers pee standing.
Students pee all over.

802
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,083
Right, dear?

803
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:26,833
Yes, that's right, Vin.
Just listen to your dad.

804
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:28,333
See? Right?

805
00:33:28,416 --> 00:33:30,333
It's not every day that I agree with you.

806
00:33:30,833 --> 00:33:32,083
Help your dad.

807
00:33:32,166 --> 00:33:33,000
I'm going, brother.

808
00:33:33,083 --> 00:33:34,250
-Yes, take care, No.
-Okay.

809
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,500
Vin, help me take this stuff
to Mr. Haji's place.

810
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:41,583
What? I have to attend an event at school.

811
00:33:41,666 --> 00:33:45,125
Vin, it's a Saturday.
It's just an extracurricular activity.

812
00:33:45,208 --> 00:33:46,416
It won't take long, okay?

813
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:53,375
-Is it still far, Dad?
-Relax, Vin.

814
00:33:53,791 --> 00:33:55,333
Five more turns.

815
00:33:55,416 --> 00:33:58,041
Three left, two right.

816
00:33:58,416 --> 00:33:59,833
Why can't we use a map?

817
00:34:00,333 --> 00:34:01,916
Gosh, Vin.

818
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,166
Do you think if we use a map
we can get there instantly?

819
00:34:05,291 --> 00:34:06,416
No, right?

820
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,500
Do it like this. I know the way.

821
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:11,583
Then why can't you send a courier?
Why must we deliver it ourselves?

822
00:34:12,166 --> 00:34:15,916
You'll see why I want
to make a delivery myself.

823
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,583
-Here you go, Mr. Haji.
-Gosh.

824
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,166
My congregation will love this.

825
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:24,583
-Yes.
-The quality of your bags...

826
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:25,666
Like this.

827
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:28,750
You're too kind, Mr. Haji.

828
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:30,583
Mr. Haji.

829
00:34:30,666 --> 00:34:32,250
I made these special for you.

830
00:34:32,583 --> 00:34:33,416
Special.

831
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:35,291
Twenty-five percent discount.

832
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:37,666
But don't tell anyone, Mr. Haji.

833
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:40,416
Then I'll order 300 pieces.

834
00:34:41,791 --> 00:34:43,333
This is 300.

835
00:34:43,416 --> 00:34:44,583
We complete each other, huh?

836
00:34:46,166 --> 00:34:47,333
Come on, Dim.

837
00:34:47,583 --> 00:34:50,000
Just stir it up. Do it right.

838
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:51,125
Count them first, Mr. Haji.

839
00:34:51,208 --> 00:34:53,916
Anggara, I've been your customer
for a long time.

840
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,500
-No need for that.
-Just in case.

841
00:34:55,583 --> 00:34:57,000
Dad, I unloaded them all.

842
00:34:57,083 --> 00:34:57,916
-Done?
-Yes.

843
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,916
You got everything?

844
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:00,500
Is this your kid?

845
00:35:00,583 --> 00:35:02,083
-Yes, my kid.
-Goodness.

846
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:07,000
That's good. A son helping his father.
Don't be ashamed, don't be embarrassed.

847
00:35:07,083 --> 00:35:09,750
Because embarrassment is more dangerous
than the embargo.

848
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:11,500
Listen to him, Kevin.

849
00:35:12,666 --> 00:35:14,333
Well, you know how kids are.

850
00:35:14,666 --> 00:35:17,083
Just as they say, when a tree falls,

851
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,083
the fruits fall,

852
00:35:19,916 --> 00:35:21,750
not far from the boat, sir.

853
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:27,083
I don't get it.

854
00:35:27,833 --> 00:35:29,333
I swear I don't get it.

855
00:35:29,416 --> 00:35:31,333
Like father, like son.

856
00:35:31,416 --> 00:35:32,583
Oh, right.

857
00:35:32,833 --> 00:35:33,750
This...

858
00:35:33,833 --> 00:35:34,916
Whose this?

859
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,583
-It's yours.
-Oh, right.

860
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:38,083
Vin...

861
00:35:38,291 --> 00:35:39,750
Is your school still far away?

862
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,000
Five more turns.

863
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:44,250
Three to the left, two to the right.

864
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,083
That's why you should take me to school
once in a while.

865
00:35:49,166 --> 00:35:51,916
Yes. I want that as well.

866
00:35:52,291 --> 00:35:54,166
But I'm busy with lots of work.

867
00:35:54,416 --> 00:35:57,000
Like today, for example.
I had to make a delivery.

868
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:59,833
But Dad,
do you usually give discounts like that?

869
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:01,500
What if Mom finds out?

870
00:36:01,916 --> 00:36:03,000
Look, Vin.

871
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:06,916
In business,
we don't need profits all the time.

872
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:10,416
But we also need blessings.
Like what I did.

873
00:36:10,958 --> 00:36:12,875
I'm sure Mr. Haji will pray
for my business.

874
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:14,750
Profits are important.

875
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,583
But we have to be honest.

876
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:23,916
We must not cheat
and be mean just to gain something.

877
00:36:25,916 --> 00:36:29,083
-Remember that, okay?
-Yes, Dad.

878
00:36:29,833 --> 00:36:31,333
So how's your day?

879
00:36:31,416 --> 00:36:33,416
It's great, thank you for asking.
How about you?

880
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,750
Yes, I'm doing well. I guess.

881
00:36:34,833 --> 00:36:37,416
I'm fine. Have you studied English?

882
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,958
Cause we have a lot to study...

883
00:36:39,041 --> 00:36:41,041
I'm looking at Cindy and Chelsea.

884
00:36:42,458 --> 00:36:43,458
I thought it was Aldo.

885
00:36:43,791 --> 00:36:44,625
Enough.

886
00:36:45,416 --> 00:36:47,333
Hurry, stir it up. Hey!

887
00:36:47,416 --> 00:36:48,750
-Jo, we're going.
-Come on.

888
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:52,000
Kevin will catch up with us.
This will get ruined!

889
00:36:52,416 --> 00:36:53,250
Come on!

890
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:55,083
I'll get off up front, Dad. It's close.

891
00:36:55,583 --> 00:36:58,000
-Which way?
-Up front.

892
00:37:01,458 --> 00:37:02,375
Remind me.

893
00:37:02,708 --> 00:37:03,791
Why are we here?

894
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,958
-You got caught!
-You got caught!

895
00:37:07,833 --> 00:37:10,000
You're lucky my expensive bag
didn't get stained.

896
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,166
Had it gotten dirty,

897
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:12,833
can you three afford to pay for it?

898
00:37:13,958 --> 00:37:15,166
It's a knock off.

899
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:17,708
If I make this go viral,
you're all finished.

900
00:37:19,458 --> 00:37:20,291
Chel.

901
00:37:20,375 --> 00:37:22,750
Vin, what's with your friends?

902
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:25,666
They tried to pour this stuff
onto the English Club members.

903
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:28,125
You know how much the English Club
means to me, Vin!

904
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:30,000
They were looking
for Doraemon's magic pocket

905
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:32,000
and helped the Monkey King
to find the scriptures

906
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,166
and help Naruto to defeat Madara
to become a Hokage.

907
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,583
I'll explain later.

908
00:37:35,666 --> 00:37:38,083
Why not now? We're all here.

909
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:39,750
This is our club activity.

910
00:37:40,416 --> 00:37:41,333
What club?

911
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,500
Nasojel Club.

912
00:37:43,916 --> 00:37:45,000
Remind me.

913
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:46,583
What's "Nasojel"?

914
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:48,666
People who eat...

915
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:51,083
People who love long gel.

916
00:37:51,708 --> 00:37:53,333
National Society
of Jelly Enthusiasts Club.

917
00:37:53,416 --> 00:37:54,250
There!

918
00:37:54,333 --> 00:37:57,708
Wait. National Society
of Jelly Enthusiasts Club?

919
00:37:58,875 --> 00:38:01,208
Truly, seance students are weird.

920
00:38:01,625 --> 00:38:02,500
-Science.
-Science.

921
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:04,583
Yes, that's what I meant.
Don't correct me.

922
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:06,833
Enough. I don't understand this.

923
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,416
Don't try this again. Clean everything.

924
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:13,125
Chel.

925
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,416
Fine, if Chelsea said so.

926
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,833
Wait.

927
00:38:18,333 --> 00:38:19,666
What about my expensive bag?

928
00:38:20,166 --> 00:38:21,666
-It's a knock off!
-It's a knock off!

929
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,333
Chel.

930
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,333
What?

931
00:38:24,625 --> 00:38:28,375
Look. Actually, I started all this.
They only tagged along because it was fun.

932
00:38:28,458 --> 00:38:29,583
What I didn't tell you is that

933
00:38:29,666 --> 00:38:31,833
we are accepting prank challenges
from a website.

934
00:38:31,916 --> 00:38:34,083
Website? You didn't tell me about it.

935
00:38:34,166 --> 00:38:35,666
Now you're putting our lives at risk?

936
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:36,583
Yes, sorry.

937
00:38:36,666 --> 00:38:37,708
A few days back,

938
00:38:37,791 --> 00:38:39,583
I found this website,
studentrebelguide.com.

939
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,541
This website's like a game.
There are challenges.

940
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:42,458
Wait a minute.

941
00:38:42,541 --> 00:38:45,125
A person like you
did silly stuff like this

942
00:38:45,208 --> 00:38:46,708
just because of an internet challenge?

943
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:49,000
But I tried to cancel it, Chel.
I texted you.

944
00:38:49,083 --> 00:38:50,166
They want to hurry!

945
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,500
-What should I do?
-Enough.

946
00:38:51,583 --> 00:38:53,083
I'll go grab my bag. I'm going home.

947
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:54,750
Okay, I'm sorry.

948
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,333
But we have a new purpose now.

949
00:38:56,416 --> 00:38:57,416
To expose...

950
00:38:58,125 --> 00:38:58,958
Graft practice.

951
00:38:59,041 --> 00:39:00,000
Oh, right.

952
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:02,250
But I'm still playing
as Vino G. Bastian, period.

953
00:39:02,333 --> 00:39:04,083
I'm going to grab my bag
and go after Chelsea.

954
00:39:04,291 --> 00:39:06,000
-What?
-Hey, what about Vino?

955
00:39:06,083 --> 00:39:08,083
Wait a second. Dim, Jo, remind me.

956
00:39:08,416 --> 00:39:09,500
What is all this?

957
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:12,250
Student Rebel? Graft practice?

958
00:39:12,333 --> 00:39:13,208
Vino Bas...

959
00:39:13,291 --> 00:39:15,750
Vino, he was in the movie
Catatan Akhir Sekolah.

960
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,666
Who was the star? Iqbal Ramadhan?

961
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:18,583
Vino.

962
00:39:18,666 --> 00:39:20,750
-Vino Ramadhan?
-Vino G. Bastian!

963
00:39:21,083 --> 00:39:21,916
Chel.

964
00:39:22,416 --> 00:39:23,250
Chel.

965
00:39:23,625 --> 00:39:25,500
Chel.

966
00:39:27,416 --> 00:39:28,458
Chel.

967
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:33,416
Chelsea.

968
00:39:33,833 --> 00:39:34,916
-Chel.
-Vin.

969
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,416
What's with you? You're so noisy!

970
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,833
I want to apologize.

971
00:39:38,916 --> 00:39:39,750
Vin.

972
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:42,166
I want you to stop doing those challenges!

973
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:43,750
I just can't understand.

974
00:39:43,833 --> 00:39:45,708
Why did you get carried away
with stuff like this?

975
00:39:45,791 --> 00:39:48,125
Didn't you tell me to keep a high spirit
for this last school year?

976
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,166
Oh, so it's my fault?

977
00:39:50,375 --> 00:39:51,333
No.

978
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:53,333
Relax, you won't become a victim.

979
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:56,666
Why shouldn't I?
Why don't you make me a victim as well?

980
00:39:56,916 --> 00:39:58,166
What's so special about me?

981
00:39:58,333 --> 00:39:59,583
Because I consider you as my...

982
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,916
Like my PS1 that I used to play at home,
and then my parents scolded me.

983
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
You're weird.

984
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,166
Chel! Chelsea!

985
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,833
Chel!

986
00:40:14,416 --> 00:40:17,291
Thank you so much for singing
at my church event.

987
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,416
You're welcome.

988
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:20,583
Hey, what made you decide to ask me?

989
00:40:20,916 --> 00:40:24,083
Because I remember that during high school
you had a great voice.

990
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,416
-Right?
-Do you remember that?

991
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,541
But... No, I'm curious.

992
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:30,541
Why didn't you use this talent of yours?

993
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,833
Well...

994
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,083
If only I was certain about my dreams,

995
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,583
there wouldn't be songs like

996
00:40:39,666 --> 00:40:41,750
Everything

997
00:40:42,125 --> 00:40:45,166
Is because of love

998
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:47,625
-Okay.
-Like that.

999
00:40:47,708 --> 00:40:49,166
Yes, you have a great voice.

1000
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:50,250
-I do, right?
-Yes.

1001
00:40:50,833 --> 00:40:51,875
Don't embarrass us.

1002
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,500
But no, your voice is great.
Really, it's great.

1003
00:40:55,583 --> 00:40:56,458
I make you ashamed.

1004
00:40:56,833 --> 00:40:57,666
Yes.

1005
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,083
But you missed me, right?

1006
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:00,500
Well, I mean...

1007
00:41:01,166 --> 00:41:04,375
It makes you miss me... No, I mean...
It reminds you...

1008
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,333
Yes.

1009
00:41:09,083 --> 00:41:10,666
-Come, eat these.
-Okay.

1010
00:41:14,083 --> 00:41:14,916
Jo!

1011
00:41:16,916 --> 00:41:19,583
-Sir, take Lady to her stable.
-Okay.

1012
00:41:19,666 --> 00:41:21,916
Be patient!
If I don't feed Grandpa's horse,

1013
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,583
it wants to return to the Netherlands.

1014
00:41:25,041 --> 00:41:27,500
Guys, we'll stop doing pranks for a week.

1015
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:29,000
What? Why?

1016
00:41:29,083 --> 00:41:32,500
-Aren't you the most enthusiastic?
-Yes, I've been staring at this website.

1017
00:41:32,583 --> 00:41:34,500
You guys are insensitive.

1018
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:36,666
This clearly has something to do
with Chelsea.

1019
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:38,666
-No!
-Really?

1020
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:40,291
If you ask me,

1021
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:42,708
you two are like Song Hye-kyo
and Song Joong-ki.

1022
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:43,625
So adorable.

1023
00:41:43,708 --> 00:41:44,583
Remind me, Jo.

1024
00:41:45,083 --> 00:41:46,333
Who's Romeo and Juliet?

1025
00:41:46,416 --> 00:41:49,625
What Romeo and Juliet?
Song Hye-kyo and Song Joong-ki.

1026
00:41:49,791 --> 00:41:52,333
Right. Song Joong-ki and Song Song Song.

1027
00:41:52,583 --> 00:41:54,500
How should I know? You think I'm a Song...

1028
00:41:54,583 --> 00:41:55,666
Writer?

1029
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:56,916
Enough!

1030
00:41:57,083 --> 00:41:58,750
We stopped doing pranks
not because of Chelsea,

1031
00:41:58,833 --> 00:42:01,291
but because we're preparing
for a bigger prank.

1032
00:42:01,583 --> 00:42:02,500
-Really?
-Really?

1033
00:42:02,583 --> 00:42:03,666
Yes, take a look.

1034
00:42:08,416 --> 00:42:09,916
Mr. Margono...

1035
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,666
Finally, that day came.

1036
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:13,750
I will expose all the dishonesties
in this school.

1037
00:42:13,833 --> 00:42:16,416
Received a delivery...

1038
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:18,416
Which then...

1039
00:42:20,666 --> 00:42:22,083
-Be ready.
-Be ready.

1040
00:42:22,166 --> 00:42:23,708
-Be ready.
-Ready.

1041
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,791
-Open the door.
-Open the door.

1042
00:42:26,875 --> 00:42:27,750
Open the door.

1043
00:42:27,833 --> 00:42:29,625
-It's open, sir.
-The car!

1044
00:42:30,416 --> 00:42:32,666
Good day, gentlemen.

1045
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:36,208
Mrs. Dibyo. Welcome to our school.

1046
00:42:36,916 --> 00:42:38,833
How was your trip?

1047
00:42:38,916 --> 00:42:40,000
Safe?

1048
00:42:42,041 --> 00:42:45,000
Actually, the trip wasn't very nice.

1049
00:42:45,083 --> 00:42:47,125
So my condition at this moment,

1050
00:42:47,208 --> 00:42:48,500
I don't have much time

1051
00:42:48,583 --> 00:42:50,583
because I'm meeting RI 3.

1052
00:42:50,666 --> 00:42:53,000
-Don't you mean RI 2?
-Three.

1053
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:54,333
All right.

1054
00:42:54,416 --> 00:42:55,625
-Let's get started, ma'am.
-Yes.

1055
00:42:55,708 --> 00:42:57,416
-Let's observe the activities...
-Sure.

1056
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,083
Can you please clean up this walkway?

1057
00:42:59,166 --> 00:43:00,500
Of course, right away.

1058
00:43:00,583 --> 00:43:01,416
Right.

1059
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:06,416
Four thousand rupiah per kilogram.

1060
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,750
How much

1061
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:10,708
will his profit be?

1062
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:12,166
Please come in, ma'am.

1063
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:13,416
Good day.

1064
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,500
-Good day to you all.
-Good day, sir.

1065
00:43:16,083 --> 00:43:17,666
-Operational cost...
-Ma'am.

1066
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:20,541
Mrs. Dibyo, we should allow
this teaching process...

1067
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:22,500
in progress, ma'am. Just let him be.

1068
00:43:23,083 --> 00:43:24,333
He's concentrating.

1069
00:43:25,166 --> 00:43:26,000
Okay.

1070
00:43:28,333 --> 00:43:29,916
It's so crowded.

1071
00:43:30,083 --> 00:43:32,666
How come there are only four of them?
Are the others skipping class?

1072
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:34,583
No, ma'am. They're not skipping class.

1073
00:43:34,666 --> 00:43:35,833
This is the science class.

1074
00:43:35,916 --> 00:43:37,333
It only has four students.

1075
00:43:37,416 --> 00:43:39,000
These four are the best, ma'am.

1076
00:43:39,125 --> 00:43:40,250
So we facilitate them.

1077
00:43:40,333 --> 00:43:41,750
We prepared this class for them.

1078
00:43:41,833 --> 00:43:42,833
Do you get it?

1079
00:43:42,916 --> 00:43:43,833
I do.

1080
00:43:43,916 --> 00:43:45,833
Right. That's right.

1081
00:43:45,916 --> 00:43:48,750
What's with that one in the back,
wearing a headband?

1082
00:43:48,833 --> 00:43:51,500
Do you have a headache?
Are the lessons too difficult?

1083
00:43:51,583 --> 00:43:53,416
Or maybe you can't keep up
with this class?

1084
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,375
Yes.

1085
00:43:55,416 --> 00:43:57,333
But that kid looks a bit...

1086
00:43:57,416 --> 00:43:58,250
Old.

1087
00:43:58,333 --> 00:44:00,000
Oh, no. He's not old.

1088
00:44:01,416 --> 00:44:02,416
He's just a kid.

1089
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,416
But he does look a bit older.

1090
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:08,583
It's understandable.
Kids nowadays look older than their age.

1091
00:44:08,833 --> 00:44:09,916
Now let us check...

1092
00:44:10,333 --> 00:44:11,416
Our toilets and tribunes.

1093
00:44:11,833 --> 00:44:13,416
Oh, yes. Fine.

1094
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:15,333
-Please, this way.
-Tribunes...

1095
00:44:16,916 --> 00:44:17,750
Just a second, sir.

1096
00:44:18,333 --> 00:44:19,500
Right. Carry on.

1097
00:44:19,666 --> 00:44:20,625
Let's move on.

1098
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,791
About our water,

1099
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:26,208
we produce our own here from a well.

1100
00:44:26,416 --> 00:44:29,916
So the participants don't need to worry
about water shortage.

1101
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,250
Everything is under control.

1102
00:44:31,416 --> 00:44:32,416
Oh, okay.

1103
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:33,750
Shall we inspect it, ma'am?

1104
00:44:35,416 --> 00:44:36,500
I can't.

1105
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:44,500
-I apologize, ma'am. I didn't realize.
-It's okay.

1106
00:44:44,583 --> 00:44:46,833
Mr. Bambang,
please demonstrate our waterworks.

1107
00:44:47,666 --> 00:44:49,833
Mr. Juki. Demonstrate it.

1108
00:44:50,166 --> 00:44:51,000
Yes, sir.

1109
00:44:52,416 --> 00:44:53,750
Goodness! What's with you?

1110
00:44:53,833 --> 00:44:56,083
Telling that temporary teacher to do it?
I don't trust him.

1111
00:44:56,166 --> 00:44:57,625
-Go with him.
-Okay, sir.

1112
00:44:59,708 --> 00:45:01,208
I don't trust him either. Please.

1113
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,333
Yes, ma'am.

1114
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,250
-Hold this.
-Yes.

1115
00:45:15,916 --> 00:45:19,000
-Amazing!
-Such strong pressure, ma'am.

1116
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,666
Here it is, ma'am.

1117
00:45:22,083 --> 00:45:23,666
About our sports field...

1118
00:45:24,416 --> 00:45:28,250
The size of our school field
is very much ideal.

1119
00:45:28,916 --> 00:45:32,250
It follows international caliber.
And the size is extraordinary.

1120
00:45:33,833 --> 00:45:34,666
That tribune...

1121
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,333
People can sit on it, right?

1122
00:45:36,416 --> 00:45:37,500
Oh, about that tribune...

1123
00:45:37,583 --> 00:45:40,250
It's under the process
of being repaired...

1124
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,500
It's possible. Why not?

1125
00:45:42,583 --> 00:45:43,666
Let's try it.

1126
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:46,666
-Mr. Bambang!
-Yes, sir?

1127
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:48,666
Please test the tribune, all right?

1128
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:49,583
Mr. Juki.

1129
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:50,916
Check the tribune.

1130
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
-Me?
-Yes.

1131
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:53,666
-Right, sir.
-Stop asking Juki!

1132
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:54,583
Both of you!

1133
00:45:54,666 --> 00:45:56,000
Yes, sir. Ready.

1134
00:45:56,083 --> 00:45:57,000
Mr. No!

1135
00:45:57,083 --> 00:45:59,416
Go with them. I don't trust them.

1136
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:00,416
Yes, ma'am.

1137
00:46:00,583 --> 00:46:01,833
Jo, remind me.

1138
00:46:02,083 --> 00:46:03,916
Did I light the match or not?

1139
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:05,750
What's with you?

1140
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,208
It's safe, Mr. Juki.

1141
00:46:11,291 --> 00:46:13,041
-It's safe.
-It was built using the proper funds.

1142
00:46:13,125 --> 00:46:14,500
I wouldn't embezzle it.

1143
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:17,333
Get off!

1144
00:46:17,916 --> 00:46:19,083
What is he saying?

1145
00:46:19,166 --> 00:46:22,083
I think he's telling you to step down

1146
00:46:22,166 --> 00:46:24,583
from your position as the headmaster.

1147
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:25,750
Get off!

1148
00:46:37,583 --> 00:46:38,416
Vin!

1149
00:46:39,666 --> 00:46:42,416
-Vin!
-Who told you to lay down there?

1150
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:44,250
Sorry! My firecrackers!

1151
00:46:46,666 --> 00:46:52,166
I think, based on what I see
I have to give it a second thought.

1152
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:56,750
It seems impossible for this school
to organize...

1153
00:46:57,333 --> 00:46:59,083
Club... What's its name?

1154
00:46:59,166 --> 00:47:01,666
-Super Student Cup, ma'am.
-Right.

1155
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:03,416
I think it's impossible.

1156
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:05,083
-I...
-Okay, thank you.

1157
00:47:05,166 --> 00:47:07,833
Actually, I...

1158
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:17,000
I'm sure all parents here already know
why I gathered you in this room.

1159
00:47:17,083 --> 00:47:20,750
This incident is so heartbreaking!

1160
00:47:20,833 --> 00:47:25,000
All thanks to your children

1161
00:47:25,083 --> 00:47:28,416
who have committed a brutal act!

1162
00:47:29,083 --> 00:47:30,250
Such a mess!

1163
00:47:30,833 --> 00:47:31,750
Excuse me, sir.

1164
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:32,833
Yes, what is it?

1165
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:34,958
I'm Baris Napitupulu

1166
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:38,333
asking permission
to speak privately with Jo.

1167
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:39,750
Yes, go ahead.

1168
00:47:42,166 --> 00:47:43,041
I...

1169
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:46,666
came all the way
from the border of our country!

1170
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:48,791
Now I'm at the border of my emotions!

1171
00:47:49,416 --> 00:47:53,125
Your attitude is embarrassing...

1172
00:47:53,416 --> 00:47:54,416
Me!

1173
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:56,250
Do you understand?

1174
00:47:58,166 --> 00:48:01,416
I spent all my money
on your school tuition!

1175
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,333
And you caused trouble?

1176
00:48:03,666 --> 00:48:05,041
What's with this kid?

1177
00:48:05,416 --> 00:48:06,750
You humiliate me.

1178
00:48:06,833 --> 00:48:08,916
I've never done
anything like this in my life.

1179
00:48:09,333 --> 00:48:11,000
Bon, remind Daddy.

1180
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,583
Your grades are good this time, right?

1181
00:48:14,333 --> 00:48:15,166
They're good, Dad.

1182
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:16,583
But this is not about that.

1183
00:48:18,833 --> 00:48:21,250
Sir, we all heard your phone conversation.

1184
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:23,500
And we all suspect
that you're committing graft practice.

1185
00:48:23,583 --> 00:48:26,583
That's why we tried to ruin the
Super Student Cup plan for this school,

1186
00:48:26,666 --> 00:48:28,000
to expose your crime!

1187
00:48:28,083 --> 00:48:28,916
Kevin!

1188
00:48:29,583 --> 00:48:31,500
What are you talking about?

1189
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:32,583
Excuse me, sir.

1190
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:34,833
I...

1191
00:48:35,333 --> 00:48:36,166
And you...

1192
00:48:36,416 --> 00:48:38,166
We are both servants of the country!

1193
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:39,750
I maintain security!

1194
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:41,666
You maintain education!

1195
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:44,333
Don't let the headmaster turn into...

1196
00:48:44,583 --> 00:48:47,083
headless.

1197
00:48:48,583 --> 00:48:50,500
Death sentences for corrupt officials.

1198
00:48:51,083 --> 00:48:54,750
For goodness sake, sir!

1199
00:48:55,333 --> 00:48:57,166
Why can't you be a good role model?

1200
00:48:57,833 --> 00:49:01,000
This is an amazing achievement, Vin.

1201
00:49:01,083 --> 00:49:02,750
Bon, remind Daddy.

1202
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,083
What are we here for?

1203
00:49:06,416 --> 00:49:07,833
Our headmaster committed corruption.

1204
00:49:07,916 --> 00:49:08,875
Corruption?

1205
00:49:10,083 --> 00:49:13,083
Sir! Corruption is my department!

1206
00:49:13,166 --> 00:49:15,083
I'm a lawyer for corrupt officials.

1207
00:49:15,166 --> 00:49:17,333
If I defend you
from the beginning to the end,

1208
00:49:17,416 --> 00:49:19,416
you will be acquitted of all charges.

1209
00:49:19,583 --> 00:49:20,500
Just relax, sir.

1210
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:22,375
It's my reputation, sir!

1211
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:23,916
For ten years,

1212
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,250
I was the best headmaster!

1213
00:49:26,333 --> 00:49:28,083
I've never committed
any corruption offense.

1214
00:49:28,166 --> 00:49:30,416
We all heard your phone conversation.

1215
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,833
You talked about money.

1216
00:49:31,916 --> 00:49:33,666
And how hard it's going to be
when you retire.

1217
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:34,583
Right, guys?

1218
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:35,916
That's right.

1219
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,583
-Just admit it!
-We heard it!

1220
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,666
-Admit it!
-I'll call Uncle Hotman.

1221
00:49:42,833 --> 00:49:45,000
Children, listen.

1222
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:49,416
Our headmaster here
always craves achievement.

1223
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,583
His narcissism can't be helped.

1224
00:49:51,666 --> 00:49:53,500
And he thinks he's so handsome.

1225
00:49:53,583 --> 00:49:54,833
A bit reckless.

1226
00:49:54,916 --> 00:49:58,250
But one thing I can say about Mr. Rustam

1227
00:49:58,666 --> 00:50:00,833
is that he is an honest man.

1228
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:02,333
I agree!

1229
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:06,083
Mr. Rustam never committed corruption!

1230
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:09,000
Honest!

1231
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:11,750
As the school treasurer,

1232
00:50:11,833 --> 00:50:13,083
I have valid data.

1233
00:50:13,916 --> 00:50:15,250
In fact, Mr. Rustam here

1234
00:50:15,375 --> 00:50:18,750
has been covering
the school's lack of funds.

1235
00:50:18,833 --> 00:50:20,416
I have the complete record.

1236
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,166
We have the record, don't we, Mr. Tito?

1237
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:25,250
Do you have the record, Mr. Juki?

1238
00:50:26,416 --> 00:50:28,666
Mr. Juki? Yes, sir. We have the record.

1239
00:50:29,166 --> 00:50:30,250
Excuse me, sir.

1240
00:50:35,666 --> 00:50:36,666
You!

1241
00:50:37,333 --> 00:50:39,333
Are embarrassing...

1242
00:50:39,583 --> 00:50:40,500
Me!

1243
00:50:40,666 --> 00:50:43,083
I almost turned the headmaster headless!

1244
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:45,750
It would be better
if he's the head of a branch!

1245
00:50:45,833 --> 00:50:48,666
If I shoot one head,
he still has another branch!

1246
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:49,916
Do you understand?

1247
00:50:50,416 --> 00:50:55,250
Truly, slandering is worse than killing!

1248
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:56,416
Do you understand?

1249
00:50:56,833 --> 00:50:58,500
You have to study seriously!

1250
00:50:59,666 --> 00:51:01,666
Our kind shouldn't mess around!

1251
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:03,916
Bon, remind Daddy.

1252
00:51:05,833 --> 00:51:06,833
Who committed corruption?

1253
00:51:06,916 --> 00:51:09,250
-Nobody did, Dad.
-I see.

1254
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:11,250
Enough! Stop all this!

1255
00:51:11,583 --> 00:51:12,833
All merits,

1256
00:51:13,166 --> 00:51:15,166
especially ones
I have done all this time...

1257
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:16,833
There's no need to talk about them.

1258
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,416
But there's punishment

1259
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:22,416
for students who have committed
this brutal act!

1260
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,750
I will give a suspension!

1261
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:28,083
To you, you, you and you!

1262
00:51:28,666 --> 00:51:29,833
And Kevin,

1263
00:51:30,416 --> 00:51:32,166
I will give you more suspension!

1264
00:51:32,916 --> 00:51:34,250
A longer one.

1265
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:38,000
That school tribune incident
was never in my plan.

1266
00:51:38,833 --> 00:51:40,750
Remind me, Jo. What blueprint is this?

1267
00:51:40,833 --> 00:51:42,541
This is the blueprint for our future home.

1268
00:51:43,083 --> 00:51:45,083
Suddenly I remembered
this is our school's blueprint.

1269
00:51:45,583 --> 00:51:47,833
I did plan to sabotage the evaluation day.

1270
00:51:47,916 --> 00:51:48,958
What, no punctuation?

1271
00:51:49,041 --> 00:51:50,958
Add an emoji or something.
Make it look friendly.

1272
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:52,416
A colon and a bracket or something?

1273
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,833
The Super Student Cup preparations
felt wrong from the start.

1274
00:51:54,916 --> 00:51:56,583
That's why I felt the need
to give a lesson.

1275
00:51:56,666 --> 00:51:58,250
Some of the sabotage worked.

1276
00:51:58,333 --> 00:51:59,666
Place this bucket on top.

1277
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:01,666
Tie it to the door. When the door opens,

1278
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:03,166
and Mr. Tito comes out--

1279
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:05,166
Got you! Mr. Tito!

1280
00:52:06,166 --> 00:52:08,583
What's all the ruckus and calling my name?

1281
00:52:08,666 --> 00:52:10,000
Remind me, Jo. What are we doing?

1282
00:52:10,416 --> 00:52:11,833
You want to mop the floor.

1283
00:52:11,916 --> 00:52:13,000
She's right.

1284
00:52:13,166 --> 00:52:14,666
-I'll mop the floor.
-Get the mop.

1285
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:15,750
That's good.

1286
00:52:16,083 --> 00:52:17,166
That's right.

1287
00:52:17,833 --> 00:52:19,333
Shake it, Bon. Don't be so stiff.

1288
00:52:19,416 --> 00:52:20,875
Okay, sir.

1289
00:52:28,833 --> 00:52:30,083
-Excuse me, sir.
-Hey, you.

1290
00:52:30,666 --> 00:52:31,500
Yes, sir?

1291
00:52:32,083 --> 00:52:33,166
Do you think

1292
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:34,916
I'll look good as a headmaster?

1293
00:52:35,083 --> 00:52:36,458
You look good, sir.

1294
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:38,000
Try this, sir.

1295
00:52:40,083 --> 00:52:41,833
Sounds good, sir. You look dignified.

1296
00:52:41,916 --> 00:52:43,333
-Dignified?
-I'm heading home, sir.

1297
00:52:43,416 --> 00:52:44,333
Go ahead.

1298
00:52:45,333 --> 00:52:47,166
Some plans ran smoothly.

1299
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:51,333
Well, some failed.

1300
00:52:51,416 --> 00:52:52,500
Hey, who vandalized this?

1301
00:52:52,708 --> 00:52:53,583
I don't know.

1302
00:52:53,666 --> 00:52:55,333
And it's more attractive with punctuation.

1303
00:52:55,416 --> 00:52:56,916
It's more proper. We got caught.

1304
00:52:57,041 --> 00:52:58,041
We're screwed. I'm out.

1305
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,750
Actually, I wanted to meet
the last challenge.

1306
00:53:01,833 --> 00:53:04,416
Create commotion throughout the school
with fireworks.

1307
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:06,250
I asked you to take the box
behind the door.

1308
00:53:06,333 --> 00:53:08,000
It is a box for Chinese New Year delivery.

1309
00:53:08,083 --> 00:53:09,666
Bon, he asked you to bring that one.

1310
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:11,083
And you brought this one.

1311
00:53:11,166 --> 00:53:13,416
What? He asked me
to bring this one, not that one.

1312
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,416
This and that.
Why are we bringing firecrackers?

1313
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:16,333
Relax.

1314
00:53:16,416 --> 00:53:17,458
Trust Bon-bon.

1315
00:53:17,916 --> 00:53:19,666
What are you afraid of? It's safe.

1316
00:53:20,166 --> 00:53:22,916
Sure. Can you please
clean up this walkway?

1317
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,208
The entourage is here!

1318
00:53:24,333 --> 00:53:26,000
So you know the story.

1319
00:53:26,083 --> 00:53:29,000
Thanks to Bon-bon bringing a firecracker
instead of a sparkler.

1320
00:53:30,083 --> 00:53:31,750
A son like you gives me a headache.

1321
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,250
I've told you so many times.

1322
00:53:34,333 --> 00:53:35,833
You have to study seriously!

1323
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:40,250
Now you're suspended, I'm embarrassed!

1324
00:53:40,583 --> 00:53:42,333
Honey, give it a rest.

1325
00:53:43,916 --> 00:53:45,083
Let me talk to him.

1326
00:53:48,583 --> 00:53:49,583
Vin.

1327
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:52,000
I'm sorry.

1328
00:53:53,416 --> 00:53:57,416
All this time, I never took you to school.

1329
00:53:57,916 --> 00:53:59,083
You know how it is.

1330
00:53:59,916 --> 00:54:01,333
I'm busy with the store.

1331
00:54:02,666 --> 00:54:04,916
Making deliveries here and there.

1332
00:54:05,916 --> 00:54:07,500
I'm not a rich guy.

1333
00:54:08,083 --> 00:54:09,833
This store is all I have, Vin.

1334
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:14,333
Even my promise to your Mom,
to buy a shophouse at Pantai Indah Kapuk,

1335
00:54:14,833 --> 00:54:17,166
I haven't fulfilled it to this day.

1336
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:20,750
I'm not like other Chinese people, Vin.

1337
00:54:21,333 --> 00:54:23,750
I won't force you to run this store.

1338
00:54:26,833 --> 00:54:28,583
You can be whatever you want.

1339
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:32,000
You can be a doctor, an engineer.

1340
00:54:32,083 --> 00:54:33,125
If possible,

1341
00:54:33,666 --> 00:54:34,916
you can be a governor.

1342
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:35,916
It's all right.

1343
00:54:36,083 --> 00:54:37,916
But what's important

1344
00:54:38,083 --> 00:54:40,250
is that you have to be somebody.

1345
00:54:40,916 --> 00:54:44,125
A good person. Honest and hardworking.

1346
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:46,791
Don't achieve anything the instant way.

1347
00:54:49,416 --> 00:54:51,750
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

1348
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:55,833
That was good, honey.

1349
00:54:56,333 --> 00:54:58,666
I like that. No proverbs.

1350
00:55:11,291 --> 00:55:12,125
Hello?

1351
00:55:13,833 --> 00:55:14,916
Excuse me.

1352
00:55:17,166 --> 00:55:18,000
Chel.

1353
00:55:20,666 --> 00:55:22,166
My mother asked me to buy some thread.

1354
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:23,416
Thread...

1355
00:55:24,833 --> 00:55:25,750
We have some.

1356
00:55:26,375 --> 00:55:27,666
But... Just a second.

1357
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:29,833
I need to talk to you.

1358
00:55:29,916 --> 00:55:30,916
What do you want to say?

1359
00:55:31,708 --> 00:55:33,041
You want to say that you're happy?

1360
00:55:33,666 --> 00:55:35,916
For making a bad memory
in our last school year?

1361
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:37,416
Do you know?

1362
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,250
Since you got suspended,

1363
00:55:39,583 --> 00:55:41,250
Bon-bon and Johana have been shunned.

1364
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,083
Nobody cares about them.

1365
00:55:44,166 --> 00:55:45,125
And Dimas...

1366
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,666
His parents are planning to transfer him.

1367
00:55:48,958 --> 00:55:49,833
One more thing, Vin.

1368
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:53,750
This year, our school won't host
the Super Student Cup.

1369
00:55:54,416 --> 00:55:55,500
We're disheartened.

1370
00:55:56,416 --> 00:55:57,416
I hope it's true.

1371
00:55:58,291 --> 00:56:00,291
That our last year means a lot to you.

1372
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,208
I'm done. I'm not buying your thread.

1373
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:09,583
The store next door sells thread.

1374
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:10,666
Thanks.

1375
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:13,583
Vin.

1376
00:56:16,625 --> 00:56:17,916
What's with this kid?

1377
00:56:24,583 --> 00:56:27,250
When I was in high school,
I was naughty just like you.

1378
00:56:29,916 --> 00:56:31,083
No, I was worse.

1379
00:56:37,833 --> 00:56:38,666
Here.

1380
00:56:41,208 --> 00:56:42,916
I was a school band vocalist.

1381
00:56:43,583 --> 00:56:46,666
You know how girls are crazy
about band members?

1382
00:56:47,333 --> 00:56:48,916
The Handsome Brother.

1383
00:56:49,375 --> 00:56:51,000
For kids nowadays, I would be like...

1384
00:56:51,083 --> 00:56:52,083
a YouTuber.

1385
00:56:54,833 --> 00:56:57,750
If only I was sure in the path I chose,

1386
00:56:58,083 --> 00:56:59,500
there wouldn't be songs like

1387
00:56:59,583 --> 00:57:01,583
Everything

1388
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:05,416
Is because of love

1389
00:57:05,833 --> 00:57:07,750
-Everything...
-Who's song is that?

1390
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:10,625
Someone.

1391
00:57:15,166 --> 00:57:18,333
I wish I hadn't doubted her support.

1392
00:57:18,583 --> 00:57:20,333
I wouldn't have lost everything.

1393
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,750
Isn't this Bella Fauzi, that presenter?

1394
00:57:26,583 --> 00:57:27,500
The point, Vin, is...

1395
00:57:28,416 --> 00:57:29,750
don't be like me.

1396
00:57:31,166 --> 00:57:32,166
Who lives with doubts.

1397
00:57:34,166 --> 00:57:35,916
Yes, Uncle. I understand.

1398
00:57:36,166 --> 00:57:38,333
Kids nowadays would say,

1399
00:57:39,625 --> 00:57:40,583
"Move on."

1400
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:00,666
Just like my uncle
who had a passion for music,

1401
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:02,000
I too used to love writing.

1402
00:58:02,083 --> 00:58:04,291
1ST PLACE WRITING CONTEST

1403
00:58:06,625 --> 00:58:09,500
Until I lost that spirit to write

1404
00:58:09,583 --> 00:58:11,250
because the society made me doubt myself.

1405
00:58:16,541 --> 00:58:19,041
-Lame!
-You suck!

1406
00:58:19,125 --> 00:58:22,166
-You nerd!
-MSG kid!

1407
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:35,541
Affected by people's words,
I finally stopped writing.

1408
00:58:54,916 --> 00:58:57,833
Maybe it's time for me to return
to the world that I believe.

1409
00:59:02,666 --> 00:59:04,083
Doing what I'm good at.

1410
00:59:04,333 --> 00:59:06,833
So I can be honest and be myself.

1411
00:59:11,083 --> 00:59:14,083
Making mistakes in life
is not the end of everything.

1412
00:59:14,416 --> 00:59:16,791
What's important is to get back up.

1413
00:59:30,666 --> 00:59:33,000
How diligent, sitting in front
of the computer this early.

1414
00:59:36,250 --> 00:59:37,750
It's useless to just write, Vin.

1415
00:59:38,416 --> 00:59:40,666
It's meaningless
if you don't apply it in your life.

1416
00:59:41,083 --> 00:59:42,583
Have you moved on yourself?

1417
00:59:53,333 --> 00:59:55,333
Hey, whoever is reading this,

1418
00:59:55,416 --> 00:59:57,416
I just want to say, I'm fine.

1419
00:59:57,583 --> 00:59:59,500
Well, I broke my left arm.

1420
00:59:59,583 --> 01:00:01,916
But other than that, I'm perfectly well.

1421
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:05,333
During my absence in writing,
a lot of things happened.

1422
01:00:05,416 --> 01:00:06,416
Bon.

1423
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,416
Remind me, who are you?

1424
01:00:17,916 --> 01:00:19,333
Kevin!

1425
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:21,875
With these, I forgive you.

1426
01:00:22,416 --> 01:00:23,333
Sincerely.

1427
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,750
You miss your hometown
in the Netherlands, don't you?

1428
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:30,250
It's hot in here, I know.

1429
01:00:30,833 --> 01:00:32,500
Unlike your hometown.

1430
01:00:35,875 --> 01:00:38,666
Cock a doodle doo!

1431
01:00:40,333 --> 01:00:41,333
That's a rooster!

1432
01:00:43,666 --> 01:00:45,416
Remind me, Jo.
What does a horse sound like?

1433
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,583
How should I know? Ask my Grandpa's horse!

1434
01:00:48,666 --> 01:00:50,333
I don't speak Dutch!

1435
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:51,666
What does a horse sound like?

1436
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:54,166
Again.

1437
01:00:57,916 --> 01:00:59,500
You miss me, don't you?

1438
01:01:01,583 --> 01:01:02,500
Really...

1439
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:04,500
That's okay, it's good.

1440
01:01:06,166 --> 01:01:08,416
-Peace be upon you.
-Dimas!

1441
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:09,666
Excuse us!

1442
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:13,250
May the peace and mercy of Allah
be with you as well!

1443
01:01:13,333 --> 01:01:15,083
What are you doing here?

1444
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:18,083
You dare come here, looking for Dimas?

1445
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:20,416
Dimas is here,
but I won't allow him to come out.

1446
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:22,625
What has he been doing at school?

1447
01:01:22,916 --> 01:01:25,500
I've sold my cows, my farmland,

1448
01:01:25,583 --> 01:01:26,666
just to send my son to school!

1449
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:28,000
And he fooled around!

1450
01:01:28,083 --> 01:01:29,416
Thanks to you, brats!

1451
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:32,333
Jo, remind me. What language is this?

1452
01:01:32,416 --> 01:01:33,250
Kroya.

1453
01:01:34,750 --> 01:01:35,916
Korean.

1454
01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:38,750
Dimas is actually from Korea.

1455
01:01:38,833 --> 01:01:39,916
You got that?

1456
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,416
We're here to apologize, ma'am.

1457
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:42,833
Apologize?

1458
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:44,583
Wait until Eid al-Fitr!

1459
01:01:44,666 --> 01:01:45,625
Gosh.

1460
01:01:45,833 --> 01:01:47,333
We have to fast for 30 days first?

1461
01:01:47,666 --> 01:01:49,583
Think before you act!

1462
01:01:51,333 --> 01:01:53,083
Mother, what are you doing?

1463
01:01:53,583 --> 01:01:55,541
I've topped up our internet data.

1464
01:01:55,625 --> 01:01:57,166
You can watch your Korean drama again.

1465
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:58,833
-I can watch my movies again?
-Yes.

1466
01:01:58,916 --> 01:02:00,083
-It's connected?
-It is.

1467
01:02:00,333 --> 01:02:01,666
Good boy.

1468
01:02:03,166 --> 01:02:04,166
You should pray first.

1469
01:02:04,291 --> 01:02:06,291
-No problem.
-Yes.

1470
01:02:07,583 --> 01:02:09,500
I have to bribe her
with internet data, man.

1471
01:02:10,916 --> 01:02:13,666
-She's Korean?
-What do you think?

1472
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:15,500
-Not really.
-Of course not.

1473
01:02:15,583 --> 01:02:18,333
How silly of you to trust that.
How can a face like this be Korean?

1474
01:02:18,416 --> 01:02:19,916
Your mom said she's Korean!

1475
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,250
Kroya, near Cilacap!

1476
01:02:23,083 --> 01:02:25,833
Dim, we brought you something
so you can show your talent.

1477
01:02:25,916 --> 01:02:26,750
Jo, show him.

1478
01:02:27,333 --> 01:02:28,500
Ta-da!

1479
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:32,333
Dance competition!

1480
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,666
Dance competition?

1481
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:36,250
-Yes!
-Dance competition?

1482
01:02:36,333 --> 01:02:37,166
Yes!

1483
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:39,250
-Competition!
-Yes!

1484
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:43,000
Dimas! The "screaming" is not working!

1485
01:02:43,083 --> 01:02:45,125
I can only see that round thing
turning and turning!

1486
01:02:45,208 --> 01:02:47,083
The picture won't come out!

1487
01:02:47,166 --> 01:02:48,083
You mean streaming?

1488
01:02:48,291 --> 01:02:49,500
"Screaming!"

1489
01:02:49,583 --> 01:02:51,166
-Yes, streaming.
-It's not working!

1490
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:52,666
That's why you should pray first.

1491
01:02:53,166 --> 01:02:54,416
Watching Korean dramas every day.

1492
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Why are these brats...

1493
01:02:56,083 --> 01:02:58,833
-May peace be upon you, Kroya!
-And upon you too!

1494
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,583
-What's with those brats?
-Maybe they have things to do.

1495
01:03:01,666 --> 01:03:02,833
Come on, "screaming."

1496
01:03:29,041 --> 01:03:31,416
How is your preparation? Good?

1497
01:03:32,916 --> 01:03:33,833
What room is this?

1498
01:03:36,166 --> 01:03:37,000
English Club.

1499
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:44,500
Well, do you think everything is fine?

1500
01:03:51,583 --> 01:03:53,750
Chicken. Fried chicken. I'll buy you one.

1501
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:06,416
WE CAN STILL BE THE WINNERS

1502
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:08,583
I need you to make a cool vlog
for our school.

1503
01:04:10,833 --> 01:04:11,916
Your English sucks.

1504
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:15,000
Okay, I'll help you.

1505
01:04:18,833 --> 01:04:20,000
I'll buy you fried chicken.

1506
01:04:21,833 --> 01:04:23,416
Guys, I have important information.

1507
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,166
We are not the host!

1508
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:28,916
But that doesn't mean
we can't be the winner!

1509
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,833
Our high school still has hope!

1510
01:04:30,958 --> 01:04:32,500
Our high school still has...

1511
01:04:32,583 --> 01:04:34,583
I'm hoping to bring back
the students' spirit.

1512
01:04:34,666 --> 01:04:36,166
To pay for my mistakes.

1513
01:04:36,666 --> 01:04:37,916
-Come on, Chel.
-We can do this!

1514
01:04:39,416 --> 01:04:41,083
Aldo! Let me help you.

1515
01:04:41,166 --> 01:04:42,833
Forward without fear!

1516
01:04:42,916 --> 01:04:44,416
Our high school will be the winner!

1517
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:46,500
-We can do it!
-Our high school will be the winner!

1518
01:04:46,583 --> 01:04:49,916
Guys, don't forget to share this video
as much as possible on Instagram! Okay?

1519
01:04:50,416 --> 01:04:52,166
Don't forget to subscribe
to my YouTube channel.

1520
01:04:54,250 --> 01:04:55,916
Our high school still has hope!

1521
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,250
March on!

1522
01:05:01,333 --> 01:05:03,000
I get it.

1523
01:05:25,833 --> 01:05:27,666
Oh, my!

1524
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:31,166
Guys, this is what I call an arena.

1525
01:05:31,583 --> 01:05:32,666
Do you think we can win?

1526
01:05:32,750 --> 01:05:35,583
Hey, Dim. This will be
a historical place for you.

1527
01:05:35,666 --> 01:05:36,916
Do you see those faces?

1528
01:05:37,333 --> 01:05:39,166
Those are the faces that you will defeat.

1529
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:41,125
-Gosh.
-Hey, you!

1530
01:05:41,208 --> 01:05:43,375
Other dance competition participants!
You better give up!

1531
01:05:43,458 --> 01:05:45,083
Because my friend here will be the winner.

1532
01:05:45,166 --> 01:05:46,583
Go back to your mom's house!

1533
01:05:47,916 --> 01:05:49,916
What are you looking at?
Do you want us to beat you badly?

1534
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,833
-Which one, Jo?
-That one!

1535
01:05:51,916 --> 01:05:54,916
Do you know who taught
Michael Jackson to dance?

1536
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,333
-My friend over here!
-Lord Dimas!

1537
01:05:57,416 --> 01:05:58,500
Dimas from Korea!

1538
01:05:58,583 --> 01:05:59,666
-Let's get inside.
-Let's.

1539
01:05:59,750 --> 01:06:00,583
Come on, Dim.

1540
01:06:02,666 --> 01:06:03,500
Dim!

1541
01:06:05,125 --> 01:06:06,250
Hey, where are you going?

1542
01:06:06,333 --> 01:06:08,583
I can't! I want to go home!

1543
01:06:08,666 --> 01:06:10,083
I'm embarrassed in front of them!

1544
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:12,000
See? When he's scared,
his Korean comes out.

1545
01:06:12,083 --> 01:06:13,583
We're in front of the gate. Why scared?

1546
01:06:13,666 --> 01:06:15,833
Your words are giving me stage fright!

1547
01:06:15,916 --> 01:06:17,416
We're supporting you!

1548
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:20,083
But not like that! I'm getting cold feet!

1549
01:06:20,166 --> 01:06:22,083
Maybe I can only dance
in front of those kids!

1550
01:06:22,166 --> 01:06:23,916
Just imagine dancing
in front of those kids!

1551
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,416
Easy for you to say!
You never dance every time I tell you to!

1552
01:06:28,166 --> 01:06:29,416
See? Come on, shake it!

1553
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,583
-That wasn't bad.
-Come on, you can do it.

1554
01:06:34,666 --> 01:06:36,166
-Come on, Dim.
-Come on.

1555
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:37,500
Dimas!

1556
01:06:37,583 --> 01:06:38,833
Keep it down.

1557
01:06:38,916 --> 01:06:42,333
Welcome to the 20th Super Student Cup!

1558
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:48,083
Over the years,
this event has been sponsored

1559
01:06:48,166 --> 01:06:50,458
by our sweetest lady,

1560
01:06:50,583 --> 01:06:52,666
Mrs. Dibyo!

1561
01:06:56,416 --> 01:07:00,666
Our lovely audience,
this year will be different than the last.

1562
01:07:00,791 --> 01:07:04,708
This is 2018. Last year was 2017.

1563
01:07:08,583 --> 01:07:13,250
This year, we'll have
a lot of competitions.

1564
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:16,708
We have wall climbing,
skateboarding, go-karting,

1565
01:07:16,791 --> 01:07:18,750
dancing, and a singing competition!

1566
01:07:18,833 --> 01:07:21,500
And most importantly,
we'll have an English debate!

1567
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:27,666
Give a round of applause!

1568
01:07:27,750 --> 01:07:29,166
Let the games begin!

1569
01:07:40,791 --> 01:07:43,541
Gosh, they're all good.

1570
01:07:44,166 --> 01:07:45,916
Our school's score is falling behind.

1571
01:07:46,791 --> 01:07:47,916
MEDAL TABLE

1572
01:07:48,041 --> 01:07:51,250
Hey, relax. We still have Dimas.

1573
01:07:51,583 --> 01:07:53,833
Hey, man, why are you
putting pressure on me?

1574
01:07:53,916 --> 01:07:55,500
Dim, relax. You can do this.

1575
01:07:55,583 --> 01:07:57,833
Our school still has Chelsea
and her English Club.

1576
01:07:58,416 --> 01:08:01,166
-Bon, join the go-cart race.
-I can't drive.

1577
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:03,833
You can do everything, Bon.
You just forget about it all this time.

1578
01:08:03,916 --> 01:08:05,416
-Is that true, Jo?
-Yes!

1579
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:06,916
Jo, you can sing.

1580
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,250
He...

1581
01:08:08,333 --> 01:08:10,000
-Not now!
-Not now!

1582
01:08:10,166 --> 01:08:11,208
In the competition.

1583
01:08:11,833 --> 01:08:13,333
-Sir, sign her up.
-On it.

1584
01:08:13,416 --> 01:08:15,833
Keep your spirits up!
Our school can do this!

1585
01:08:17,416 --> 01:08:19,166
Dimas!

1586
01:08:33,083 --> 01:08:34,583
You can do it!

1587
01:08:40,083 --> 01:08:41,416
This kid.

1588
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:43,000
This "screaming" is so nice.

1589
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:44,250
Smooth.

1590
01:09:36,416 --> 01:09:38,750
Hello, guys. For all...

1591
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:42,083
Welcome to the Super Student Cup.

1592
01:09:42,166 --> 01:09:43,875
English debate!

1593
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:47,583
Our debate contestants are

1594
01:09:48,375 --> 01:09:49,291
Harapan

1595
01:09:49,375 --> 01:09:50,500
Mrs. Ana

1596
01:09:51,208 --> 01:09:52,291
High School...

1597
01:09:52,375 --> 01:09:54,500
Buana!

1598
01:09:54,708 --> 01:09:56,000
"Mrs." is mom.

1599
01:09:56,541 --> 01:09:58,416
Mom is "Bu", "Ibu."

1600
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:01,041
"Ana" is your school. So?

1601
01:10:01,125 --> 01:10:02,666
No problem! Yes!

1602
01:10:04,333 --> 01:10:05,208
And this is...

1603
01:10:05,625 --> 01:10:06,500
69...

1604
01:10:06,875 --> 01:10:08,000
High School!

1605
01:10:10,083 --> 01:10:11,333
You know SMU?

1606
01:10:13,916 --> 01:10:15,750
S is "I".

1607
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:17,916
Mu, "You".

1608
01:10:19,416 --> 01:10:21,083
You and I.

1609
01:10:23,166 --> 01:10:24,083
And guys...

1610
01:10:24,166 --> 01:10:26,916
This is the topic for the debate.

1611
01:10:27,166 --> 01:10:30,416
What is your opinion

1612
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:32,916
about your generation?

1613
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:33,833
Gen Z!

1614
01:10:36,166 --> 01:10:37,000
Please welcome!

1615
01:10:37,083 --> 01:10:38,250
69 High School!

1616
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,833
Harapan Buana High School!

1617
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:03,250
Very, very good afternoon!

1618
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:33,833
Yes!

1619
01:12:04,041 --> 01:12:05,375
In today's society,

1620
01:12:05,625 --> 01:12:07,250
we're labeled the "MSG Generation."

1621
01:12:08,166 --> 01:12:10,416
Maybe it's because we have everything
at our fingertips.

1622
01:12:10,791 --> 01:12:12,166
But if you do one mistake,

1623
01:12:12,416 --> 01:12:14,583
it will be recorded,
and affect our future.

1624
01:12:15,083 --> 01:12:17,583
A threat that didn't exist
in our previous generation.

1625
01:12:26,166 --> 01:12:27,916
We are not a perfect generation.

1626
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,166
But like all the generations before us,

1627
01:12:30,541 --> 01:12:33,000
we will carry on and find our own way.

1628
01:12:40,208 --> 01:12:43,500
Welcome to our Singing Competition final!

1629
01:12:44,833 --> 01:12:50,458
I'm not the one
That you've always dreamed of

1630
01:12:51,166 --> 01:12:56,500
I'm not her who has everything

1631
01:12:56,916 --> 01:13:03,250
I've never hoped that our story
Can become beautiful

1632
01:13:03,583 --> 01:13:07,500
But there's one thing I need you for

1633
01:13:10,041 --> 01:13:12,500
Have you ever realized

1634
01:13:13,166 --> 01:13:16,458
Every tear that falls

1635
01:13:16,958 --> 01:13:18,875
Down my cheek

1636
01:13:18,958 --> 01:13:24,708
I'm not the one
That you've always dreamed of

1637
01:13:25,541 --> 01:13:31,041
I'm not her who has everything

1638
01:13:31,541 --> 01:13:37,541
I've never hoped that our story
Can become beautiful

1639
01:13:37,916 --> 01:13:40,416
But there's one thing I need you for...

1640
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:44,583
The overall champion
for the 20th Super Student Cup is...

1641
01:13:44,666 --> 01:13:47,041
Harapan Buana High School!

1642
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,875
My beloved students,

1643
01:13:57,958 --> 01:14:00,041
I am so proud of you.

1644
01:14:00,791 --> 01:14:01,875
Proud!

1645
01:14:02,833 --> 01:14:03,833
Yes!

1646
01:14:14,583 --> 01:14:15,708
Awesome!

1647
01:14:17,166 --> 01:14:18,833
You're all great students!

1648
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:33,250
Honey, Mr. Haji Imran is here!

1649
01:14:34,166 --> 01:14:36,666
Stop putting Leo under the sun.
He'll get dark. Come on.

1650
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,166
-Just a minute, sir.
-Yes.

1651
01:14:40,458 --> 01:14:41,541
Mr. Haji.

1652
01:14:41,916 --> 01:14:44,375
-How are you, sir?
-I'm good, thank goodness.

1653
01:14:44,625 --> 01:14:45,541
Yes.

1654
01:14:45,833 --> 01:14:47,416
Why do you have to come all the way here?

1655
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:49,291
If you need any merchandise, just call me.

1656
01:14:49,375 --> 01:14:50,958
I just want to maintain our relationship.

1657
01:14:51,041 --> 01:14:53,500
Also, I want to hand you
this wedding invitation.

1658
01:14:54,916 --> 01:14:56,083
You're getting married again?

1659
01:14:57,791 --> 01:15:00,875
Share some tips with me, sir.
How to get married again.

1660
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:05,750
What are you whispering about?
You want to get married again?

1661
01:15:05,833 --> 01:15:07,166
Mr. Haji, just so you know.

1662
01:15:07,250 --> 01:15:10,291
He promised me a shophouse
at Pantai Indah Kapuk.

1663
01:15:10,375 --> 01:15:12,416
Now I'm old and I still haven't gotten it.

1664
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:14,333
-You dare get married again?
-Honey.

1665
01:15:14,416 --> 01:15:16,666
The one getting married is Mr. Haji.

1666
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:18,583
You old coot! Pervert!

1667
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,583
You old coot! Pervert!

1668
01:15:20,916 --> 01:15:22,166
Hey! Honey!

1669
01:15:22,583 --> 01:15:24,000
Don't repeat everything I say!

1670
01:15:25,125 --> 01:15:26,416
No!

1671
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:28,750
Check who the groom is.

1672
01:15:29,041 --> 01:15:31,041
Read it. Imran Jr.

1673
01:15:31,125 --> 01:15:32,083
Imron Junior.

1674
01:15:32,166 --> 01:15:34,166
I'm Imron A. Imron Aja.

1675
01:15:36,083 --> 01:15:36,916
See, honey?

1676
01:15:37,333 --> 01:15:39,500
The one getting married is his junior.

1677
01:15:39,833 --> 01:15:41,000
My son.

1678
01:15:41,333 --> 01:15:42,916
We're sorry, Mr. Haji. Sorry.

1679
01:15:43,166 --> 01:15:44,083
Sorry.

1680
01:16:03,625 --> 01:16:04,541
Sir.

1681
01:16:07,708 --> 01:16:08,666
Kevin.

1682
01:16:09,791 --> 01:16:10,750
Sit.

1683
01:16:21,791 --> 01:16:22,750
What is it?

1684
01:16:22,833 --> 01:16:25,791
I wanted to help an old lady cross
the street and have lunch with you and--

1685
01:16:25,875 --> 01:16:26,708
Kevin.

1686
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:29,541
You don't have to rush anything.

1687
01:16:31,166 --> 01:16:32,416
Take it slow.

1688
01:16:33,375 --> 01:16:34,333
What is it?

1689
01:16:38,208 --> 01:16:39,666
I want to apologize, sir.

1690
01:16:44,666 --> 01:16:45,500
Kevin.

1691
01:16:47,333 --> 01:16:49,541
I forgave you already.

1692
01:16:50,583 --> 01:16:53,125
And I've read your writings.

1693
01:16:55,041 --> 01:16:55,875
It's good.

1694
01:16:57,041 --> 01:16:58,333
Keep writing.

1695
01:16:58,666 --> 01:16:59,875
Be more detailed.

1696
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:01,875
Be more specific.

1697
01:17:03,208 --> 01:17:05,041
I'm sure it will turn out well.

1698
01:17:06,333 --> 01:17:07,166
Okay?

1699
01:17:08,083 --> 01:17:09,000
Thank you, sir.

1700
01:17:09,916 --> 01:17:10,916
Okay.

1701
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Kevin.

1702
01:17:14,916 --> 01:17:15,916
Yes, sir?

1703
01:17:18,458 --> 01:17:19,708
One more thing.

1704
01:17:22,541 --> 01:17:26,375
If you do everything sincerely,

1705
01:17:28,208 --> 01:17:30,708
you will be successful.

1706
01:17:33,208 --> 01:17:34,208
Thank you, sir.

1707
01:17:47,666 --> 01:17:48,916
Luna.

1708
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:52,625
I'm coming.

1709
01:17:53,250 --> 01:17:55,583
Vin, how's our final year?

1710
01:17:59,583 --> 01:18:00,416
Impressive.

1711
01:18:01,583 --> 01:18:03,000
Come on, let's take the picture!

1712
01:18:03,083 --> 01:18:05,500
I spent five years in high school
just for this picture, come on.

1713
01:18:06,250 --> 01:18:09,291
-What took so long?
-It's like waiting for the bus.

1714
01:18:10,708 --> 01:18:12,541
Jo, remind me.

1715
01:18:12,833 --> 01:18:13,833
What are we doing?

1716
01:18:14,166 --> 01:18:17,500
-Family picture, Bon!
-Family picture, Bon!

1717
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:19,083
Bon.

1718
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:22,250
Remind Daddy. Whose parent is this?

1719
01:18:25,666 --> 01:18:27,250
Hey, man!

1720
01:18:27,666 --> 01:18:28,833
That thing.

1721
01:18:29,166 --> 01:18:30,333
I haven't got any.

1722
01:18:30,583 --> 01:18:32,000
-Oh, no.
-Dang!

1723
01:18:32,333 --> 01:18:33,833
It's that thing guy again!

1724
01:18:34,916 --> 01:18:36,750
For goodness sake!

1725
01:18:36,833 --> 01:18:39,666
Hey, what's with his thing?

1726
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:41,000
That thing...

1727
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:44,166
He didn't give me his thing.

1728
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:47,416
Excuse me, everyone.

1729
01:18:48,750 --> 01:18:50,583
Can we just get on with it?

1730
01:18:51,416 --> 01:18:54,750
Take...

1731
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,000
The picture!

1732
01:18:56,416 --> 01:18:57,291
#HIGHSCHOOLGRADUATION

1733
01:18:57,375 --> 01:18:59,000
School is finally over.

1734
01:18:59,750 --> 01:19:01,166
While I waited for college,

1735
01:19:01,833 --> 01:19:04,416
I cleaned up my blog
and posted my absurd stories at school.

1736
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,083
Wait a minute!

1737
01:19:07,666 --> 01:19:09,416
I win!

1738
01:19:10,333 --> 01:19:11,500
In his retirement,

1739
01:19:11,583 --> 01:19:14,833
the headmaster became
the head of National Zebra Dove Lovers.

1740
01:19:14,916 --> 01:19:18,333
Well, wherever he is,
he's always becoming a leader.

1741
01:19:18,416 --> 01:19:19,500
Luna.

1742
01:19:19,583 --> 01:19:20,708
#WINNINGBIRD

1743
01:19:26,250 --> 01:19:27,333
Somebody moved on.

1744
01:19:27,916 --> 01:19:28,750
You?

1745
01:19:31,250 --> 01:19:33,333
Everything

1746
01:19:33,750 --> 01:19:35,500
Is because of love

1747
01:19:35,583 --> 01:19:37,500
A publisher was interested in my stories.

1748
01:19:37,583 --> 01:19:38,916
My writings were made into a book.

1749
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,375
Finally, my book got published.

1750
01:19:40,458 --> 01:19:42,750
If you want to buy one, go to a bookstore.

1751
01:19:42,833 --> 01:19:44,458
The cover is yellow.

1752
01:19:44,541 --> 01:19:46,083
Pay at the cashier. Great!

1753
01:19:53,250 --> 01:19:56,250
How convenient. Reading books.

1754
01:19:56,333 --> 01:19:59,333
It's as if you own them,
but you're not buying them.

1755
01:19:59,416 --> 01:20:02,166
Just like a library.

1756
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:04,083
Honey, it's all right.

1757
01:20:04,250 --> 01:20:05,333
Let them be.

1758
01:20:05,583 --> 01:20:06,833
Just consider it like this.

1759
01:20:07,166 --> 01:20:10,250
These kids are appreciating
our son's work.

1760
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:12,333
Let them be?

1761
01:20:12,583 --> 01:20:15,666
If it stays like this, when will I get
that shophouse at Pantai Indah Kapuk?

1762
01:20:17,541 --> 01:20:19,250
Kevin's book...

1763
01:20:19,333 --> 01:20:21,333
How come there are no spaces
between the sentences?

1764
01:20:21,666 --> 01:20:23,333
You smarty pants!

1765
01:20:23,416 --> 01:20:24,916
You should get your eyes checked.

1766
01:20:25,166 --> 01:20:27,666
This book is awesome.

1767
01:20:27,916 --> 01:20:29,166
Just like what people say.

1768
01:20:29,416 --> 01:20:31,416
"A drop of stain

1769
01:20:32,333 --> 01:20:34,416
ruins the whole piggy bank."

1770
01:20:35,333 --> 01:20:36,833
You're weird.

1771
01:20:37,416 --> 01:20:41,250
Viewers, a syndicate of a hoax website
that has been operating for some time,

1772
01:20:41,333 --> 01:20:43,500
just recently got caught
by two security guards

1773
01:20:43,583 --> 01:20:45,833
in a crowded civilian area.

1774
01:20:45,916 --> 01:20:47,583
In their operation...

1775
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:49,583
Vin.

1776
01:20:50,666 --> 01:20:51,583
This is Jes.

1777
01:20:51,916 --> 01:20:55,000
My high school friend who asked me
to sing in her church.

1778
01:20:55,416 --> 01:20:56,291
-Hi.
-I see.

1779
01:20:56,375 --> 01:20:58,208
So this is your reason to move on.

1780
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:01,666
My uncle's so talented.

1781
01:21:01,833 --> 01:21:02,833
I know.

1782
01:21:03,041 --> 01:21:07,583
Your uncle should've been
as successful as...

1783
01:21:07,916 --> 01:21:10,208
Everything

1784
01:21:10,583 --> 01:21:13,583
Is because of love

1785
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:18,666
Everything is because of love

1786
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:19,958
But how?

1787
01:21:20,041 --> 01:21:21,916
Okay, so...

1788
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,666
Since you've helped me with my church,

1789
01:21:24,875 --> 01:21:26,833
my fiancé wants to ask you
to be a recording artist.

1790
01:21:27,833 --> 01:21:28,708
Come again?

1791
01:21:29,833 --> 01:21:32,500
My fiancé wants to ask you
to be a recording artist.

1792
01:21:33,791 --> 01:21:34,625
Who's that?

1793
01:21:36,416 --> 01:21:37,833
What's with this kid?

1794
01:21:38,250 --> 01:21:39,250
Her fiancé!

1795
01:21:39,333 --> 01:21:41,250
I mean, who's that singer?

1796
01:21:41,666 --> 01:21:43,083
Her fiancé!

1797
01:21:54,208 --> 01:21:56,000
Have you known her for a long time?

1798
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,166
She's a high school friend.

1799
01:21:58,250 --> 01:21:59,750
-A high school friend?
-High school.

1800
01:22:02,208 --> 01:22:03,500
But I want to ask you something.

1801
01:22:03,916 --> 01:22:05,583
Was she this beautiful in high school?

1802
01:22:07,416 --> 01:22:08,333
She's beautiful.

1803
01:22:09,166 --> 01:22:10,500
Too bad she's engaged.

1804
01:22:13,750 --> 01:22:16,250
Everything

1805
01:22:16,458 --> 01:22:19,375
Is because of love

1806
01:22:19,625 --> 01:22:24,416
Everything is because of love

1807
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:28,833
Chelsea.

1808
01:22:29,666 --> 01:22:30,750
Chelsea.

1809
01:22:31,333 --> 01:22:32,333
Chelsea.

1810
01:22:33,083 --> 01:22:34,000
Yes.

1811
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,333
Hi, Mr. Kevin.

1812
01:22:37,416 --> 01:22:38,666
Sir, I'm here.

1813
01:22:41,750 --> 01:22:43,333
-What is it, sir?
-Why are you here?

1814
01:22:43,416 --> 01:22:44,916
I'm the security guard here.

1815
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,500
Why are you at Chelsea's house?

1816
01:22:46,583 --> 01:22:48,708
Chelsea's house is within my jurisdiction.

1817
01:22:49,041 --> 01:22:50,458
That's why I'm standing by here.

1818
01:22:50,916 --> 01:22:51,750
Where's Chelsea?

1819
01:22:52,083 --> 01:22:54,000
Her parents took her to college
in Bandung.

1820
01:22:57,166 --> 01:22:58,666
You miss her, don't you?

1821
01:23:05,750 --> 01:23:08,416
This is the first time
I've lived far from Chelsea.

1822
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:12,750
-There, there, Mr. Kevin.
-Sir, I'm here.

1823
01:23:12,833 --> 01:23:14,916
It doesn't feel good.

1824
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,416
There, there, Mr. Kevin.

1825
01:23:17,166 --> 01:23:19,000
You can call her if you miss her.

1826
01:23:19,208 --> 01:23:20,916
Video call.

1827
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,416
DM her on Instagram, right?

1828
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:25,166
Yes, but you don't have to hug me.

1829
01:23:25,541 --> 01:23:27,833
I hugged you here,
you told me to face this way.

1830
01:23:27,916 --> 01:23:29,166
Now you're mad.

1831
01:23:31,625 --> 01:23:33,541
Sir, LDR is difficult.

1832
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,541
Long-distance relationship.

1833
01:23:35,750 --> 01:23:36,750
Long means lengthy.

1834
01:23:36,833 --> 01:23:38,041
Distance means space.

1835
01:23:38,208 --> 01:23:39,875
Relationship means alliance.

1836
01:23:39,958 --> 01:23:41,291
Lengthy space liaison.

1837
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,916
Is that a relationship or the Cipali toll?

1838
01:23:48,166 --> 01:23:49,125
But it doesn't matter.

1839
01:23:49,208 --> 01:23:52,333
I can always find an excuse
to go to Bandung at least once a month.

1840
01:23:53,541 --> 01:23:57,041
AT NIGHT I REMEMBER YOU, AT DAY I MISS YOU
DISTANCE IS ANNOYING

1841
01:24:05,416 --> 01:24:07,333
This is what I do when I'm alone.

1842
01:24:07,708 --> 01:24:09,416
I don't want to be a prankster anymore.

1843
01:24:09,666 --> 01:24:11,416
Hey, we have a new kid.

1844
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:13,041
Hey, check his equipment.

1845
01:24:13,125 --> 01:24:14,666
You're so white, like cue stick chalk.

1846
01:24:15,458 --> 01:24:16,500
Hat.

1847
01:24:16,666 --> 01:24:17,500
Bag.

1848
01:24:17,583 --> 01:24:18,416
All right.

1849
01:24:18,750 --> 01:24:19,666
Yes, go ahead.

1850
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:20,916
Wait.

1851
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,250
Take one step backward.

1852
01:24:22,375 --> 01:24:23,333
Check his physique.

1853
01:24:23,583 --> 01:24:24,750
Let's see you squat.

1854
01:24:25,083 --> 01:24:26,208
Get up.

1855
01:24:26,416 --> 01:24:27,250
Squat.

1856
01:24:27,916 --> 01:24:28,833
Get up.

1857
01:24:29,375 --> 01:24:30,625
Smile for your seniors.

1858
01:24:30,708 --> 01:24:31,708
There you go.

1859
01:24:31,791 --> 01:24:33,166
You're so handsome like Ernest.

1860
01:24:33,250 --> 01:24:34,666
Okay. Please continue.

1861
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:35,833
Okay.

1862
01:24:35,916 --> 01:24:37,833
Hey, he called you.

1863
01:24:38,375 --> 01:24:40,000
Come back here.

1864
01:24:42,250 --> 01:24:43,250
Face that way.

1865
01:24:43,375 --> 01:24:44,583
No. Face this way.

1866
01:24:46,125 --> 01:24:48,041
Why do they call you Duck Mouth?

1867
01:24:48,291 --> 01:24:50,791
I got it when I was riding
the Kintoun Cloud to the Hogwarts School

1868
01:24:50,875 --> 01:24:53,250
while collecting the Infinity Stones
for 2019 Naruto as Hokage

1869
01:24:53,333 --> 01:24:55,166
with the help of Doraemon
and his Anywhere Door!

1870
01:24:58,166 --> 01:24:59,000
Well done!

1871
01:25:00,583 --> 01:25:03,333
-Well done, my foot!
-That is the right answer!

1872
01:25:03,416 --> 01:25:05,583
Repeat that to make it clear.

1873
01:25:05,666 --> 01:25:07,125
Repeat that. What did you say?

1874
01:25:07,208 --> 01:25:09,541
I got it when I was riding
the Kintoun Cloud to the Hogwarts School

1875
01:25:09,625 --> 01:25:11,916
while collecting the Infinity Stones
for 2019 Naruto as Hokage

1876
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,708
with the help of Doraemon
and his Anywhere Door!

1877
01:25:14,250 --> 01:25:16,000
This is the one. Brilliant answer.

1878
01:25:16,083 --> 01:25:18,083
The Republic needs people like him.

1879
01:25:18,166 --> 01:25:19,750
People need people like you.

1880
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:20,833
-Amen.
-Amen.

1881
01:25:20,916 --> 01:25:22,083
What? He was like...

1882
01:25:24,250 --> 01:25:25,166
What's your major here?

1883
01:25:25,250 --> 01:25:27,083
-Agriculture Literature!
-What?

1884
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,750
-Is there such a thing?
-You haven't heard?

1885
01:25:29,833 --> 01:25:31,166
Explain it to him.

1886
01:25:31,250 --> 01:25:33,083
We do have
the Agriculture Literature Faculty.

1887
01:25:33,333 --> 01:25:35,500
They have their midterm test
at the village rice barn.

1888
01:25:35,583 --> 01:25:37,333
Lecturers come carrying rice plants.

1889
01:25:37,416 --> 01:25:38,375
There!

1890
01:25:38,458 --> 01:25:39,583
How can you not know?

1891
01:25:40,250 --> 01:25:41,083
What's your major?

1892
01:25:41,166 --> 01:25:42,750
I'm in the Vegetation Medicine Faculty.

1893
01:25:42,833 --> 01:25:44,000
What? You?

1894
01:25:44,083 --> 01:25:45,416
Civil Registration.

1895
01:25:46,083 --> 01:25:49,000
Veterinary Medicine! Civil Engineering!
Your faculties do not exist!

1896
01:25:49,083 --> 01:25:50,333
Yes, they do.

1897
01:25:50,416 --> 01:25:51,583
Sheesh.

1898
01:25:51,666 --> 01:25:54,666
What kind of campus is this?
I can't stand this place!

1899
01:25:54,750 --> 01:25:56,500
You're giving me a headache.

1900
01:25:59,041 --> 01:26:00,500
-Excuse me.
-Yes, go ahead.

1901
01:26:00,916 --> 01:26:01,750
I take it back.

1902
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Being a prankster is addictive.

1903
01:26:04,291 --> 01:26:05,833
-My parents scolded me...
-You're weird.

1904
01:26:05,916 --> 01:26:06,750
Chelsea.

1905
01:26:07,416 --> 01:26:08,583
-Chel!
-What?

1906
01:26:10,416 --> 01:26:12,333
-What is it, sir?
-He was talking to me.

1907
01:26:12,416 --> 01:26:13,875
Talking to you? He was talking to me!

1908
01:26:13,958 --> 01:26:15,416
He was facing me. Right, sir?

1909
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,666
-Me.
-Me.

1910
01:26:17,750 --> 01:26:19,083
-Me!
-You're so persistent!

1911
01:26:19,166 --> 01:26:22,083
-Ask the guy. Right, sir?
-You're not facing the right direction.

1912
01:26:22,416 --> 01:26:23,250
Right, sir?

1913
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:24,333
Hey!

1914
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,333
What are you kids doing?

1915
01:26:26,583 --> 01:26:27,916
-I bet you're smoking.
-What?

1916
01:26:28,208 --> 01:26:29,500
No, sir. No.

1917
01:26:29,583 --> 01:26:31,000
Come on, break it up!

1918
01:26:33,833 --> 01:26:36,250
Look. See?

1919
01:26:38,666 --> 01:26:40,166
Over the phone, he talked about money.

1920
01:26:40,250 --> 01:26:41,250
He's about to retire.

1921
01:26:42,750 --> 01:26:43,833
It will be hard.

1922
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:45,583
Sorry!

1923
01:26:46,416 --> 01:26:47,416
This year...

1924
01:26:48,416 --> 01:26:50,250
Our school will not be the host...

1925
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:52,666
Super... My god!

1926
01:26:52,750 --> 01:26:54,708
"Welcome" means "greeting."

1927
01:26:56,750 --> 01:26:58,750
"Goodbye" means "farewell."

1928
01:27:00,416 --> 01:27:03,833
The one who will win this thing
is surely not a squirrel!

1929
01:27:05,541 --> 01:27:08,541
This music is so jazzy.

1930
01:27:08,750 --> 01:27:11,833
-Follow my lead, ready?
-Yes!

1931
01:27:18,458 --> 01:27:19,708
Thank you, Australia!

1932
01:27:19,958 --> 01:27:24,833
And if I stand today

1933
01:27:24,916 --> 01:27:27,083
-Wrong lyrics, Delon!
-Oh, right.

1934
01:27:29,041 --> 01:27:31,000
Nobody's buying thread.
Let's close the store.

1935
01:27:33,708 --> 01:27:34,541
What's wrong?

1936
01:27:34,625 --> 01:27:35,750
Hey! Are you thieves?

1937
01:27:35,833 --> 01:27:36,916
Hey, this way.

1938
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:38,833
What's wrong, man?

1939
01:27:38,916 --> 01:27:41,166
-Are you a thief?
-No, I own the store.

1940
01:27:41,250 --> 01:27:44,166
All thieves claim to be the owner
when they get caught!

1941
01:27:44,583 --> 01:27:46,500
Resisting an officer! Yellow card!

1942
01:27:46,583 --> 01:27:47,916
What is this, a soccer match?

1943
01:27:48,250 --> 01:27:49,500
-Come on!
-Annoying!

1944
01:27:49,583 --> 01:27:52,000
-Indeed.
-Hey!

1945
01:27:52,083 --> 01:27:53,583
-Are you his...
-Sir...

1946
01:27:54,250 --> 01:27:55,250
Are you his henchman?

1947
01:27:56,250 --> 01:27:57,500
He also owns the store, man.

1948
01:27:57,666 --> 01:27:58,583
Just a second.

1949
01:28:00,375 --> 01:28:01,583
-Trisno.
-Trisno.

1950
01:28:01,666 --> 01:28:03,000
And this is Kevin.

1951
01:28:04,333 --> 01:28:05,916
Christopher, let's eat chicken.

1952
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:09,000
I asked you out to eat!

1953
01:28:10,416 --> 01:28:11,333
Hey, Christopher!

1954
01:28:11,416 --> 01:28:13,500
-Excuse me, gentlemen.
-Yes, go ahead.

1955
01:28:13,666 --> 01:28:15,916
What? What's your major, huh?

1956
01:28:16,083 --> 01:28:19,791
-Hey, you two. Civil Registration?
-What's yours?
