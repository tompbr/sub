ï»¿1
00:01:09.833 --> 00:01:11.500
Men.

2
00:01:12.208 --> 00:01:14.500
For as long as they live.

3
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:17.542
they will never stop questioning

4
00:01:18.917 --> 00:01:21.250
why they are here

5
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.792
and their purpose of existence

6
00:01:26.792 --> 00:01:28.333
in this world.

7
00:01:31.917 --> 00:01:35.000
And when the time comes.

8
00:01:37.125 --> 00:01:38.542
our choices

9
00:01:39.375 --> 00:01:41.917
will be remembered by the people

10
00:01:45.208 --> 00:01:46.250
until

11
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.375
the doomsday.

12
00:01:54.125 --> 00:01:57.125
Choices to keep on living

13
00:01:58.875 --> 00:02:02.500
beyond their crippling flesh.

14
00:02:02.833 --> 00:02:04.583
their stifling bones.

15
00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:07.542
and their frailing skin.

16
00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:12.000
The noblest choice will be bestowed

17
00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:15.708
upon those believers.

18
00:02:16.875 --> 00:02:19.125
Their handsome rewards

19
00:02:19.875 --> 00:02:23.250
await in heaven

20
00:02:23.708 --> 00:02:24.917
soon enough.

21
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.417
A mining facility in Bongsun. Pahang.
was raided by the authorities

22
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.417
in the effort to cripple
drug manufacturing

23
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.083
by the narco-occult terrorist.
the group called Al-Minas.

24
00:02:47.292 --> 00:02:51.375
The raid also led to a shootout
between the two parties.

25
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.500
severely injuring the group's leader.
Husyairi Ibrahim.

26
00:02:55.583 --> 00:02:59.375
Currently. he is in ICU
at Pahang General Hospital.

27
00:04:20.625 --> 00:04:21.708
I know this is illegal.

28
00:04:22.417 --> 00:04:24.333
But garbage bags? Really?

29
00:04:26.125 --> 00:04:27.583
Nice 'boat'.

30
00:04:28.417 --> 00:04:29.458
Boat?

31
00:04:30.167 --> 00:04:32.167
No wonder you use garbage bags.

32
00:04:32.458 --> 00:04:34.125
You can't even tell a boat from a yacht.

33
00:04:45.083 --> 00:04:46.417
This is Taqiyya!

34
00:04:46.667 --> 00:04:47.875
We have to adapt!

35
00:04:49.042 --> 00:04:51.833
Your uncle must be proud to see
how you apply his teachings.

36
00:04:53.292 --> 00:04:54.417
My uncle?

37
00:04:55.208 --> 00:04:57.750
So where is he now?

38
00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:10.042
If you want to taste Husyairi's heaven.

39
00:05:10.875 --> 00:05:12.375
watch your mouth!

40
00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.583
Don't accuse.

41
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.750
Let's go!

42
00:05:28.083 --> 00:05:29.625
You ungrateful punk!

43
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.958
Hey!

44
00:05:31.458 --> 00:05:33.625
Do you think you'd get
anything without me?

45
00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:36.250
You need me. I don't need you!

46
00:05:36.333 --> 00:05:37.417
You piece of shit!

47
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.917
You are nothing without me!

48
00:05:42.125 --> 00:05:43.167
What are you doing?

49
00:05:44.875 --> 00:05:45.875
Get inside!

50
00:05:58.542 --> 00:05:59.792
Hello. everyone.

51
00:05:59.875 --> 00:06:03.708
Welcome to our big feast.

52
00:06:03.833 --> 00:06:05.917
Our special for tonight
is methamphetamine.

53
00:06:06.125 --> 00:06:08.375
But before we get started.

54
00:06:08.583 --> 00:06:14.083
let me introduce and also thank
Commissioner Adli Apdal.

55
00:06:14.417 --> 00:06:17.792
Director of Jakarta
State Intelligence Agency.

56
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.375
Sir.

57
00:06:20.833 --> 00:06:22.208
We have a big catch tonight.

58
00:06:22.375 --> 00:06:24.958
All thanks to Mr. Adli's intel.

59
00:06:26.167 --> 00:06:29.625
Or more specifically. Mr. Adli's mole.

60
00:06:30.083 --> 00:06:32.208
-Riky.
-Jijoe!

61
00:06:32.333 --> 00:06:33.292
Where is it?

62
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.708
Unit leader. this is Parameter Team.

63
00:06:42.125 --> 00:06:43.792
Our Indonesian friends are watching.

64
00:06:44.375 --> 00:06:46.292
Don't mess around. Let's do it right.

65
00:06:47.417 --> 00:06:49.708
Parameter Team. please be on standby.

66
00:06:58.208 --> 00:06:59.375
GET OUT NOW!

67
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.625
Okay. let's go.

68
00:07:07.667 --> 00:07:09.375
Hey. where are you going?

69
00:07:09.458 --> 00:07:11.292
Our business is done. Jijoe.

70
00:07:16.083 --> 00:07:17.625
Betrayer!

71
00:07:19.542 --> 00:07:20.792
We're dead.

72
00:07:24.125 --> 00:07:25.333
Quick!

73
00:07:25.792 --> 00:07:27.250
I'm going to kill you!

74
00:07:54.875 --> 00:07:55.875
Damn it!

75
00:07:59.667 --> 00:08:00.833
Get back out there.

76
00:08:01.125 --> 00:08:03.542
I need you to distract the cops.

77
00:08:04.333 --> 00:08:07.292
I'll triple your payment if you survive.

78
00:08:09.583 --> 00:08:10.500
Now!

79
00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.125
Tango. on your right!

80
00:08:27.208 --> 00:08:28.625
Dan. follow me.

81
00:09:55.667 --> 00:09:57.167
Let's go! Hurry!

82
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:19.250
Police!

83
00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.042
Police!

84
00:10:22.167 --> 00:10:24.583
-Secure the area and get them out of here.
-Yes. sir.

85
00:10:25.917 --> 00:10:27.958
Hey!

86
00:10:32.167 --> 00:10:33.458
Khai!

87
00:10:38.125 --> 00:10:39.208
Get out!

88
00:10:40.333 --> 00:10:42.708
-Okay! I'm getting out! Don't hurt me!
-Hurry up!

89
00:10:47.083 --> 00:10:48.042
Get back!

90
00:10:51.625 --> 00:10:52.833
Okay.

91
00:10:53.458 --> 00:10:55.083
Let the lady go.

92
00:10:56.125 --> 00:10:58.750
-You don't have to do this.
-Drop your gun!

93
00:11:00.375 --> 00:11:02.208
We can work this out.

94
00:11:03.875 --> 00:11:04.958
-We promise--
-Now!

95
00:11:05.042 --> 00:11:06.208
Okay!

96
00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:15.958
All of you!

97
00:11:18.208 --> 00:11:19.833
I think I knock her down.

98
00:11:21.708 --> 00:11:22.625
Don't do that. Khai.

99
00:11:24.625 --> 00:11:25.792
Put it down. Khai.

100
00:11:38.208 --> 00:11:39.833
-Dan. put your gun down.
-Sir.

101
00:11:40.375 --> 00:11:42.458
With all due respect.

102
00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.667
-what if she shoots us?
-Put it down. Mat Dan.

103
00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.292
Stay down!

104
00:12:24.083 --> 00:12:25.333
Some mole. huh?

105
00:12:25.708 --> 00:12:27.417
They knew we were coming.

106
00:12:28.917 --> 00:12:31.208
No sign of Riky at all.

107
00:12:35.583 --> 00:12:36.958
How many drugs did we score?

108
00:12:39.083 --> 00:12:41.708
-Forty kilograms.
-Forty kilograms?

109
00:12:42.417 --> 00:12:43.458
That's a lot!

110
00:12:43.542 --> 00:12:47.042
They say it's the fourth time
Riky has gotten away.

111
00:12:47.125 --> 00:12:48.750
There's something we don't know.

112
00:12:51.042 --> 00:12:53.417
Mat Dan! Come here!

113
00:12:54.792 --> 00:12:55.792
He's calling.

114
00:12:59.542 --> 00:13:00.500
Yes. sir?

115
00:13:01.167 --> 00:13:03.750
Were you taking selfies?
Do you think that's for a show?

116
00:13:04.375 --> 00:13:05.417
It's drugs.

117
00:13:07.292 --> 00:13:09.125
Here. let me teach you something.

118
00:13:10.417 --> 00:13:11.417
Give me your gun.

119
00:13:16.667 --> 00:13:17.625
What's this?

120
00:13:17.708 --> 00:13:18.708
A gun. sir.

121
00:13:18.792 --> 00:13:21.083
-What's a gun?
-Pardon?

122
00:13:21.167 --> 00:13:22.500
-What's a gun?
-A weapon.

123
00:13:22.583 --> 00:13:24.583
-A weapon is?
-A tool to catch the criminals. sir.

124
00:13:24.667 --> 00:13:25.833
A tool to catch criminals.

125
00:13:25.917 --> 00:13:27.750
Look what we've done to that poor lady.

126
00:13:32.375 --> 00:13:34.375
-We?
-The criminals use this too.

127
00:13:34.458 --> 00:13:37.292
But when we use it. we as cops

128
00:13:37.375 --> 00:13:39.750
must protect citizens. not endanger them.

129
00:13:39.833 --> 00:13:41.833
But what if they shoot us
and we don't have our guns?

130
00:13:41.917 --> 00:13:43.333
And what if she gets shot?

131
00:13:45.542 --> 00:13:46.792
Do you want to be responsible?

132
00:13:52.208 --> 00:13:53.208
I understand. sir.

133
00:13:57.333 --> 00:13:58.292
Keep it.

134
00:14:02.167 --> 00:14:03.417
Go and apologize to her.

135
00:14:05.583 --> 00:14:06.667
Yes. sir.

136
00:14:13.917 --> 00:14:16.375
That was intense.

137
00:14:17.417 --> 00:14:18.875
You were so dramatic.

138
00:14:19.833 --> 00:14:21.417
You should teach at the police academy.

139
00:14:22.792 --> 00:14:25.458
Luckily he said "tool."
or else I would slap him.

140
00:15:16.583 --> 00:15:18.583
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

141
00:16:20.167 --> 00:16:23.167
GET OUT NOW!

142
00:16:24.375 --> 00:16:25.417
Do you know

143
00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:29.542
why Riky is always ahead of us?

144
00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:31.750
Because he has a mole!

145
00:16:32.708 --> 00:16:34.375
That corrupt dog!

146
00:16:34.708 --> 00:16:38.042
Calm down. Rian. We still need you inside.

147
00:16:38.125 --> 00:16:42.000
Whoever this mole is.
I'm sure he has told Riky about me.

148
00:16:42.833 --> 00:16:46.167
Yet Riky is pretending not
to know about my identity.

149
00:16:46.542 --> 00:16:48.917
Should I talk to them individually?

150
00:16:49.167 --> 00:16:51.875
You leave that rat to me.

151
00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:54.375
But you have yet to complete your mission.

152
00:16:54.583 --> 00:16:55.625
No. sir.

153
00:16:56.208 --> 00:16:58.667
I was almost killed by cops tonight.

154
00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:00.792
Going back to Riky?

155
00:17:01.167 --> 00:17:05.083
It's like getting out of the frying pan
and into the fire.

156
00:17:05.542 --> 00:17:08.375
This mission went from six to nine months.

157
00:17:08.917 --> 00:17:10.875
It has been more than a year!

158
00:17:11.333 --> 00:17:13.125
Give me a bit more time.

159
00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:15.125
I'm running out of time. sir.

160
00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:22.875
Does anyone else know about this?

161
00:17:24.417 --> 00:17:25.500
Okay.

162
00:17:25.792 --> 00:17:30.333
I'll call the headquarters
and get you out immediately.

163
00:17:31.125 --> 00:17:32.125
All right?

164
00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:35.250
Don't worry.

165
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:38.833
Yes?

166
00:17:53.167 --> 00:17:54.083
Sir?

167
00:17:59.458 --> 00:18:01.417
You're a good cop. Rian.

168
00:18:01.792 --> 00:18:04.667
But cops need to know how to adapt.

169
00:18:06.292 --> 00:18:09.625
Do you know how I always get my catch?

170
00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:13.458
If you want to lure your target.
find a way to do it.

171
00:18:13.792 --> 00:18:15.958
You must be willing
to sacrifice everything.

172
00:18:17.167 --> 00:18:20.750
Tonight. we got 40 kilograms from Riky.

173
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.625
You were supposed to be the front!

174
00:18:26.708 --> 00:18:30.708
But lately. you are meddling
way too much now.

175
00:18:32.458 --> 00:18:33.583
Wait. sir.

176
00:18:35.583 --> 00:18:36.875
I can adapt.

177
00:18:38.375 --> 00:18:40.333
I can learn how to adapt. sir.

178
00:18:40.667 --> 00:18:42.292
So you're finally willing to learn.

179
00:18:44.833 --> 00:18:48.292
CHERONG ISLAND

180
00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:54.542
Saif.

181
00:18:56.083 --> 00:18:57.792
Riky involved the cops again.

182
00:19:00.417 --> 00:19:02.292
Did it affect our business?

183
00:19:02.958 --> 00:19:06.167
No. but I think he's strayed
from our cause.

184
00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:10.208
It's not the time yet. Najr.
We'll deal with him later.

185
00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:14.292
Tonight. we keep vigil.
Tomorrow. we'll fight.

186
00:19:15.083 --> 00:19:16.458
Inform our brothers.

187
00:20:11.958 --> 00:20:15.500
Dad. I will make you proud today.

188
00:20:24.042 --> 00:20:25.167
Goodness. you're fast!

189
00:21:07.125 --> 00:21:08.958
Thirteen to one.

190
00:21:10.208 --> 00:21:14.000
What is this. a badminton score?

191
00:21:16.125 --> 00:21:19.875
Give me a break!
Badminton is nothing compared to this.

192
00:21:19.958 --> 00:21:22.500
Come on. Let's make it 15 sets.

193
00:21:22.875 --> 00:21:24.458
Hold on! I need to catch my breath.

194
00:21:26.917 --> 00:21:29.708
Do you think
the crooks out there take breaks?

195
00:21:29.917 --> 00:21:32.208
-They don't do time-outs. Come on!
-Hey.

196
00:21:33.167 --> 00:21:34.583
Those punks!

197
00:21:36.167 --> 00:21:38.792
Get them to carry these
tires and gas tanks.

198
00:21:38.875 --> 00:21:40.000
No more excuses.

199
00:21:46.583 --> 00:21:48.042
This will be the death of me!

200
00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:53.292
If I die here.
who's going to buy you dinner tonight?

201
00:21:53.667 --> 00:21:56.125
Why would you buy me dinner?

202
00:21:56.667 --> 00:21:59.542
Hey. I know why you wear that ring.

203
00:22:00.042 --> 00:22:01.458
Don't play dumb.

204
00:22:01.792 --> 00:22:03.083
Bring your mom along.

205
00:22:03.167 --> 00:22:05.000
Tonight's dinner is on me.
We'll have seafood.

206
00:22:14.417 --> 00:22:15.500
Hello.

207
00:22:36.375 --> 00:22:37.458
Sir.

208
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:42.917
Have a look.

209
00:22:44.125 --> 00:22:46.750
Do you recognize him?
Five o'clock this morning.

210
00:22:49.792 --> 00:22:51.083
Look who showed up.

211
00:22:52.083 --> 00:22:53.250
This woman?

212
00:22:54.125 --> 00:22:55.417
So she's Adli's mole?

213
00:22:58.083 --> 00:22:59.542
This was at 5.45 a.m.

214
00:23:00.167 --> 00:23:01.292
She came out alone.

215
00:23:02.125 --> 00:23:03.875
The cleaner found Adli's body.

216
00:23:04.083 --> 00:23:06.417
Two shots to the chest. One to the head.

217
00:23:06.917 --> 00:23:08.375
Forensics found this too.

218
00:23:09.167 --> 00:23:12.417
Don't know whose cell phone it is.
Looks like a phone log.

219
00:23:12.542 --> 00:23:15.625
-One number keeps showing up.
-Can you trace the number?

220
00:23:15.833 --> 00:23:18.292
Of course.
We even got its last coordinates.

221
00:23:18.542 --> 00:23:19.542
Come.

222
00:23:22.375 --> 00:23:23.208
There.

223
00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:26.375
Cherong Island?

224
00:23:26.542 --> 00:23:30.708
You guys go take a peek.
Remember. just a peek.

225
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.292
-Gather information and report back.
-Yes. sir.

226
00:23:47.292 --> 00:23:49.542
I heard you had trouble
with cops last night.

227
00:23:49.958 --> 00:23:51.833
You shouldn't listen to gossips.

228
00:23:54.833 --> 00:23:57.833
This is MStar radar
from the Americans in Afghanistan.

229
00:23:59.208 --> 00:24:01.792
Smell it. Fresh off the line. right?

230
00:24:03.625 --> 00:24:04.917
Positive.

231
00:24:05.083 --> 00:24:07.458
Riky Kumolo. Damn. he's got nerves.

232
00:24:08.417 --> 00:24:10.875
He just got raided last night.
and he's back at it again.

233
00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:15.375
What about the others?
I've never seen them before.

234
00:24:15.458 --> 00:24:17.708
Sir. over there.

235
00:24:23.292 --> 00:24:24.208
Sani.

236
00:24:25.458 --> 00:24:27.042
Our special guest is here too.

237
00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:34.417
So. we're good?

238
00:24:38.792 --> 00:24:39.750
Not yet.

239
00:24:43.125 --> 00:24:44.208
What the hell?

240
00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:46.458
My goodness!

241
00:24:46.542 --> 00:24:48.583
-Lah. did you get that?
-Yes.

242
00:24:48.667 --> 00:24:49.958
-All of it?
-Yes. sir.

243
00:24:54.458 --> 00:24:55.833
It's time.

244
00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:59.000
Be careful.

245
00:25:01.792 --> 00:25:04.583
Lah. go to the village. Get a line.

246
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.292
-Call Captain Wazir. Tell him everything.
-Yes. sir.

247
00:25:08.417 --> 00:25:09.875
Dan. you stay here and watch them.

248
00:25:09.958 --> 00:25:12.250
Khai. you and I. We'll tail Riky.

249
00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:19.625
Saif. I have Riky.
We are heading back now.

250
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:22.042
Good. Najr.

251
00:25:23.542 --> 00:25:24.875
Get everyone ready. now.

252
00:25:43.167 --> 00:25:44.333
Drop it.

253
00:25:45.792 --> 00:25:46.792
Drop it!

254
00:25:49.042 --> 00:25:50.333
We're on the same side.

255
00:25:50.542 --> 00:25:53.083
-You're arrested for drug trafficking.
-This is a mistake.

256
00:25:53.167 --> 00:25:55.375
Also for murdering an Indonesian cop.

257
00:25:55.458 --> 00:25:56.833
I'm a cop from Indonesia.

258
00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.417
Do you think you can fool us?

259
00:26:00.667 --> 00:26:03.458
Think you can fool us?
Let's talk at the police station.

260
00:26:04.958 --> 00:26:07.417
I'm after Riky too. If he gets away--

261
00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:10.250
Don't worry.
No one's getting away this time.

262
00:26:13.625 --> 00:26:14.833
Hello. Captain Wazir?

263
00:26:15.167 --> 00:26:16.333
Hello sir?

264
00:26:19.917 --> 00:26:21.208
Damn it!

265
00:26:37.208 --> 00:26:39.292
Listen. about last night's operation.

266
00:26:39.375 --> 00:26:42.292
you only got close to Riky because of me.

267
00:26:42.875 --> 00:26:46.625
You put a gun to a civilian's head.
That's enough to arrest you.

268
00:26:46.708 --> 00:26:48.333
I had no choice.

269
00:26:48.458 --> 00:26:50.792
I'm an undercover
and you wouldn't believe me.

270
00:26:51.917 --> 00:26:53.625
How I wish Adli were still alive.

271
00:26:54.958 --> 00:26:58.333
He could help me clear the air.
Regretting yet?

272
00:27:18.375 --> 00:27:22.958
Today. you'll be one step
closer to paradise.

273
00:27:23.583 --> 00:27:25.333
You know what to do.

274
00:27:25.583 --> 00:27:26.708
Let's move!

275
00:27:49.625 --> 00:27:51.000
Hello. sir. I'm sorry. sir.

276
00:27:51.083 --> 00:27:52.542
The line was bad just now.

277
00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:53.708
Okay. so...

278
00:27:59.167 --> 00:28:01.292
Suddenly. they kidnapped him. sir.

279
00:28:03.625 --> 00:28:04.625
Sir?

280
00:28:08.292 --> 00:28:10.750
Saif. please.

281
00:28:10.917 --> 00:28:14.708
I only involved the cops
as I had guaranteed.

282
00:28:16.083 --> 00:28:18.042
Do you know the traits of a hypocrite?

283
00:28:19.333 --> 00:28:22.875
Saif. my faith is unyielding.

284
00:28:23.458 --> 00:28:24.667
I would not...

285
00:28:28.625 --> 00:28:30.083
Are you telling the truth?

286
00:28:34.792 --> 00:28:36.042
If that's true.

287
00:28:37.333 --> 00:28:39.750
then I have a greater plan for you.

288
00:28:40.125 --> 00:28:43.583
Sir. there's something wrong.
The guys we saw are coming here.

289
00:28:43.667 --> 00:28:47.750
I told Captain Wazir about Riky.
But the phone line was bad.

290
00:28:47.833 --> 00:28:49.458
-Where's Khai?
-Not here yet.

291
00:29:01.292 --> 00:29:03.542
Hello there. Looking busy. I see.

292
00:29:03.917 --> 00:29:05.250
Where's the party at?

293
00:29:08.375 --> 00:29:10.417
Hey. what are you guys up to?

294
00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:11.833
What are you...

295
00:30:00.792 --> 00:30:01.958
What's that?

296
00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:06.708
What's that?

297
00:30:07.333 --> 00:30:10.167
-What's with the smoke?
-Why are you asking me?

298
00:30:10.667 --> 00:30:12.083
Spit it! What's with that smoke?

299
00:30:12.292 --> 00:30:14.333
I swear I don't know!

300
00:30:35.292 --> 00:30:36.292
Sir!

301
00:30:41.583 --> 00:30:43.292
Lah. watch her. Dan. follow me!

302
00:30:48.583 --> 00:30:49.625
Sir!

303
00:30:57.875 --> 00:30:59.875
What do we do? Sir!

304
00:31:00.417 --> 00:31:02.792
Find wet cloths and cover your face!

305
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:06.958
Let go of me!

306
00:31:08.167 --> 00:31:09.042
Hey!

307
00:31:14.875 --> 00:31:15.750
Sit!

308
00:31:16.333 --> 00:31:17.542
Sit there!

309
00:31:22.292 --> 00:31:24.458
Sir. there's a clothesline outside.

310
00:31:24.542 --> 00:31:26.958
Dan. keep your gun away.
Don't bring it out yet.

311
00:31:27.333 --> 00:31:29.042
We don't know how many they are out there.

312
00:31:32.125 --> 00:31:33.000
Where?

313
00:31:49.333 --> 00:31:50.292
Lah!

314
00:31:52.208 --> 00:31:54.458
Lah! Stop shooting!

315
00:32:03.417 --> 00:32:04.333
Lah!

316
00:32:07.167 --> 00:32:09.708
Get in here! Lah! Here!

317
00:32:13.125 --> 00:32:14.375
Get in here. quick!

318
00:32:18.125 --> 00:32:19.042
Lah!

319
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.042
Sir. we're surrounded!

320
00:32:40.583 --> 00:32:42.583
It's your order. sir!

321
00:32:43.875 --> 00:32:45.000
Where's your gun?

322
00:32:48.417 --> 00:32:50.292
-Your gun and holster!
-But. sir...

323
00:32:50.375 --> 00:32:51.375
Now!

324
00:33:01.333 --> 00:33:04.208
Hands up! Get up!

325
00:33:04.292 --> 00:33:06.917
Hands on your head!

326
00:33:38.792 --> 00:33:39.792
Lah?

327
00:34:06.917 --> 00:34:07.917
Hey!

328
00:34:08.417 --> 00:34:09.292
Hey!

329
00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:16.792
Wake up!

330
00:34:17.208 --> 00:34:18.250
Wake up!

331
00:34:22.167 --> 00:34:24.167
Hey!

332
00:34:25.542 --> 00:34:27.250
My friends!

333
00:34:27.625 --> 00:34:29.000
Where are my friends?

334
00:34:31.542 --> 00:34:33.042
Where are my...

335
00:35:01.333 --> 00:35:02.833
Listen carefully.

336
00:35:03.375 --> 00:35:06.125
In the name of Messiah. we. the Al-Minas.

337
00:35:06.208 --> 00:35:09.708
have seized Kampung Pasir Beras
on Cherong Island.

338
00:35:10.542 --> 00:35:15.250
We have no less than 200 hostages.

339
00:35:15.417 --> 00:35:19.708
If we see any police ships or boats.

340
00:35:19.792 --> 00:35:25.292
or any vehicle within
a 10-kilometer radius of this island.

341
00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:28.792
you will see what happens.

342
00:35:48.917 --> 00:35:49.917
Sir.

343
00:35:50.167 --> 00:35:51.167
Everyone on standby?

344
00:35:51.250 --> 00:35:54.208
Yes. sir. UKAP and UNGGERIN are ready.

345
00:35:54.333 --> 00:35:55.208
QRF?

346
00:35:55.625 --> 00:35:58.375
PGM Kuantan is gathering assets
from Terengganu and Kelantan.

347
00:35:58.458 --> 00:35:59.792
and so is the 7th Battalion.

348
00:35:59.875 --> 00:36:01.542
They'll be ready in 2 hours.

349
00:36:01.625 --> 00:36:03.250
Have we verified the hostage count?

350
00:36:03.792 --> 00:36:06.000
Census records show 447 residents.

351
00:36:06.083 --> 00:36:09.000
including those who are staying in
and working outside the island.

352
00:36:09.083 --> 00:36:10.917
There are about 200 hostages.

353
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.500
-Have you checked with the satellite team?
-Yes. sir.

354
00:36:13.583 --> 00:36:14.708
It was at 1640 hours.

355
00:36:14.792 --> 00:36:17.667
The satellite detected clouds
surrounding the village.

356
00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:20.500
But on a closer look.
it's actually gas instead of clouds.

357
00:36:20.583 --> 00:36:22.458
The smoke was to lure people
out of their homes.

358
00:36:22.542 --> 00:36:24.583
We haven't identified the gas as of yet.

359
00:36:24.667 --> 00:36:28.000
But if it's CS.
it's possible they have got everyone.

360
00:36:29.083 --> 00:36:31.417
So he's not lying about the numbers.

361
00:36:31.542 --> 00:36:33.292
It's true. according to the SAT.

362
00:36:35.708 --> 00:36:36.792
All right. everyone.

363
00:36:36.917 --> 00:36:40.333
This is our head of operations.
SAC Dato' Azizat Mansur.

364
00:36:40.417 --> 00:36:43.000
Introduce yourself
and mention your designation.

365
00:36:43.833 --> 00:36:47.708
Let's put the protocols aside.
I want to know who the perpetrator is.

366
00:36:47.792 --> 00:36:49.000
We got their leader.

367
00:36:49.083 --> 00:36:51.625
They were quiet for three months.
Now. they're back at it.

368
00:36:54.083 --> 00:36:56.250
We're compiling Al-Minas profiles. ma'am.

369
00:36:56.333 --> 00:36:58.667
Have you run
the face and voice recognition?

370
00:36:58.833 --> 00:37:00.583
-Not yet. sir.
-Why not?

371
00:37:00.667 --> 00:37:02.333
-We were waiting for you.
-"Waiting for me"?

372
00:37:03.292 --> 00:37:04.667
Waiting for me to do it?

373
00:37:08.625 --> 00:37:09.708
Listen.

374
00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:13.292
We have 200 lives in our hands.

375
00:37:14.417 --> 00:37:17.292
Our enemy is ahead of us.

376
00:37:20.042 --> 00:37:24.667
I want you to sit tight.
open your eyes and ears.

377
00:37:25.333 --> 00:37:27.583
Give me everything you got.

378
00:37:28.333 --> 00:37:29.542
-Yes. sir.
-Yes. sir.

379
00:37:36.958 --> 00:37:38.917
What are you waiting for? Now!

380
00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:00.833
Sir. I've checked the hall.
Khai is not here.

381
00:38:01.417 --> 00:38:03.958
Dan. don't call me "Sir."

382
00:38:04.417 --> 00:38:06.458
I don't want them to know
that we're cops. Understand?

383
00:38:06.958 --> 00:38:08.792
-Have you checked the back?
-Yes. sir.

384
00:38:09.417 --> 00:38:12.833
Sorry. Sani. Khai is not in here.

385
00:38:33.625 --> 00:38:35.125
Do you want to stitch it yourself?

386
00:39:04.458 --> 00:39:05.958
How long was I out for?

387
00:39:06.833 --> 00:39:10.958
Three hours or so.
It's hard to find a place to fix you up.

388
00:39:13.875 --> 00:39:15.083
Where are my friends?

389
00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:16.625
I don't know.

390
00:39:17.458 --> 00:39:19.667
All I saw was chaos out there.

391
00:39:23.083 --> 00:39:24.667
Are you ever going to stop lying?

392
00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.667
Do you think I'm a part of this?

393
00:39:28.708 --> 00:39:30.833
I came here for Riky. not with Riky.

394
00:39:31.375 --> 00:39:33.917
I'm undercover in his organization.

395
00:39:34.833 --> 00:39:37.750
I know it's hard for you to believe.

396
00:39:38.417 --> 00:39:41.375
If only I could force Riky to talk.

397
00:39:42.208 --> 00:39:43.833
I can prove everything.

398
00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:49.042
But thanks to you and your friend.

399
00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:52.625
even that's a dead end now.

400
00:40:03.083 --> 00:40:04.083
Rian.

401
00:40:11.833 --> 00:40:12.917
Khai.

402
00:40:16.875 --> 00:40:19.042
You saved my life. so we're even now.

403
00:40:21.833 --> 00:40:23.250
You're leaving just like that?

404
00:40:24.417 --> 00:40:27.417
What choice do I have?

405
00:40:28.625 --> 00:40:30.000
Hey.

406
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.833
It's a mess out there.

407
00:40:39.583 --> 00:40:44.167
I don't know if you're telling the truth.
but if you're really a cop.

408
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.333
I need you to act like one now.

409
00:40:52.208 --> 00:40:54.542
Get out! I'll teach you a lesson!

410
00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:58.292
-Move!
-No. sir.

411
00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:04.625
You liar!

412
00:41:04.708 --> 00:41:07.583
Get out!

413
00:41:09.792 --> 00:41:11.750
Hey. answer me.
How many were there in the house?

414
00:41:11.833 --> 00:41:13.250
Why did you lie?

415
00:41:13.458 --> 00:41:16.667
Do you think I'm a fool?

416
00:41:17.250 --> 00:41:19.250
Please. sir!

417
00:41:20.375 --> 00:41:23.167
This is the second round-up of villagers.

418
00:41:25.458 --> 00:41:27.292
We'll follow them.

419
00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:30.125
They will lead us to Riky and my friends.

420
00:41:31.583 --> 00:41:32.667
Then what?

421
00:41:34.417 --> 00:41:36.458
We'll gather intel
and inform the headquarters.

422
00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:38.667
Then we wait for help.

423
00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:44.625
Saif. we've gotten everyone from the east.

424
00:41:45.667 --> 00:41:47.375
We're sending them to you now.

425
00:41:47.958 --> 00:41:49.250
Check again.

426
00:41:49.417 --> 00:41:51.292
Make sure the place has been emptied.

427
00:41:51.375 --> 00:41:52.417
Roger.

428
00:44:32.958 --> 00:44:34.083
It's strange. right?

429
00:44:34.708 --> 00:44:36.208
You woke up today.

430
00:44:36.292 --> 00:44:38.458
The sun rose like any morning.

431
00:44:38.542 --> 00:44:44.042
Yet here you are in the midst of doomsday.

432
00:44:47.292 --> 00:44:48.375
I'm curious.

433
00:44:48.708 --> 00:44:49.958
I have always wondered.

434
00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:53.542
Why wouldn't God reveal
when the doomsday is?

435
00:44:54.792 --> 00:45:00.167
But now as I gaze upon his servants.
I've finally understood.

436
00:45:02.792 --> 00:45:03.958
It's your faith!

437
00:45:04.625 --> 00:45:07.292
You wear your faith like a mask!

438
00:45:11.375 --> 00:45:12.708
But don't worry.

439
00:45:14.042 --> 00:45:18.625
Tonight. all your sins will be forgiven.

440
00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:23.333
But if anyone gets in our way...

441
00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:33.083
This will be the last thing you hear.

442
00:45:41.208 --> 00:45:42.250
Excuse me. sir.

443
00:45:43.583 --> 00:45:44.583
Sir.

444
00:46:00.958 --> 00:46:01.917
Well...

445
00:46:02.917 --> 00:46:04.833
In case you aren't aware.

446
00:46:04.917 --> 00:46:08.750
there are old folks and kids here.

447
00:46:09.208 --> 00:46:12.917
They are sick. starving and thirsty.

448
00:46:15.042 --> 00:46:17.292
If you're not giving us food.

449
00:46:18.250 --> 00:46:19.458
you can give us some water.

450
00:46:30.625 --> 00:46:31.667
Enough?

451
00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:41.375
Enough!

452
00:46:41.833 --> 00:46:42.875
Enough!

453
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:48.958
So do you all want water?

454
00:46:51.083 --> 00:46:52.125
Give it to them.

455
00:46:57.208 --> 00:47:00.083
-Stop it!
-We're drenched!

456
00:47:00.542 --> 00:47:02.958
Hafsyam Johari. or Saif.

457
00:47:03.042 --> 00:47:04.750
Husyairi's the mouthpiece of Al-Minas.

458
00:47:04.958 --> 00:47:06.667
This is the hand. The sword.

459
00:47:06.833 --> 00:47:10.667
He was last spotted at the Bongsun raid.
But we couldn't find the body.

460
00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:13.333
This is him five years ago.

461
00:47:13.667 --> 00:47:15.208
He was a professor at UTM.

462
00:47:15.583 --> 00:47:19.833
Double PhD in chemical engineering
and Islamic studies.

463
00:47:19.917 --> 00:47:24.917
You'd think with such accolades.
he'd be a man of true faith.

464
00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:26.083
He is a man of faith.

465
00:47:26.167 --> 00:47:28.667
That's why he had the gut
to mastermind six attacks before this.

466
00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:30.208
There were 200 casualties.

467
00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:33.167
That excludes casualties
by the drugs he manufactures.

468
00:47:33.917 --> 00:47:36.333
Guys. return to your posts.

469
00:47:36.583 --> 00:47:38.292
Okay. let me cut to the chase.

470
00:47:38.708 --> 00:47:40.792
The government won't compromise
with terrorists.

471
00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:45.500
Once they make their demands.
I can stall them but not for long.

472
00:47:46.375 --> 00:47:49.167
Commander Maarof.
How's our infiltration plan?

473
00:47:49.250 --> 00:47:50.292
It's ready. ma'am.

474
00:47:50.708 --> 00:47:54.417
According to the MET report.
it'll be overcast in four hours.

475
00:47:54.917 --> 00:47:58.375
We should only go in
when it's completely dark.

476
00:47:58.458 --> 00:48:01.708
The first team Northside.
the second-team Eastside.

477
00:48:01.792 --> 00:48:02.708
Ma'am!

478
00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:04.792
We've got a call from the island.

479
00:48:15.875 --> 00:48:18.792
This is SAC Azizat Mansur.
To whom am I speaking?

480
00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:29.458
This is Azizat Mansur.
the head of the Anti-Terrorism Unit.

481
00:48:29.542 --> 00:48:31.750
-To whom am I speaking?
-Terrorists?

482
00:48:33.625 --> 00:48:34.917
That's a harsh allegation.

483
00:48:35.917 --> 00:48:39.125
You know that it's frowned upon
when women become leaders?

484
00:48:40.042 --> 00:48:41.958
Am I speaking to Hafsyam Johari?

485
00:48:43.125 --> 00:48:44.417
What do you think?

486
00:48:47.083 --> 00:48:48.875
How can we help you. Hafsyam?

487
00:48:49.167 --> 00:48:52.875
Such arrogance.
You sound just like the Pharaoh.

488
00:48:55.542 --> 00:48:57.958
I just want to know how we can help.

489
00:48:58.292 --> 00:49:00.292
Perhaps we can negotiate peacefully.

490
00:49:00.375 --> 00:49:02.417
Now you want to know what I want?

491
00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:06.958
Your ignorant mind won't understand.

492
00:49:07.375 --> 00:49:10.667
Wait until the sun finally rises
from the West.

493
00:49:11.125 --> 00:49:13.792
Wait until the Great Fire
burns from Yemen.

494
00:49:14.333 --> 00:49:19.125
Wait until Angel Gabriel heralds
the arrival of Messiah.

495
00:49:19.958 --> 00:49:22.125
Then only on that day
will you know what I want.

496
00:49:22.458 --> 00:49:24.583
I understand what you're saying.

497
00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:26.833
How about this?

498
00:49:27.458 --> 00:49:32.208
I can set up a dialogue for you
to voice out your--

499
00:49:32.292 --> 00:49:34.000
Hey. woman! You listen to me.

500
00:49:34.583 --> 00:49:37.333
We're not doing business.
I'm not negotiating anything.

501
00:49:38.625 --> 00:49:43.708
You will have to return
Imam Husyairi to us.

502
00:49:43.958 --> 00:49:47.083
For every hour
that Imam Husyairi's not here.

503
00:49:48.875 --> 00:49:51.042
I will kill two hostages.

504
00:49:52.458 --> 00:49:53.458
Hafsyam.

505
00:49:54.542 --> 00:49:59.250
You know Husyairi is still critical.
It's risky discharging him from the ICU.

506
00:49:59.333 --> 00:50:01.750
You have no power
over life and death. Azizat.

507
00:50:02.417 --> 00:50:04.792
One hour from now!

508
00:50:04.875 --> 00:50:06.583
You know this will take time.

509
00:50:06.792 --> 00:50:11.542
Plus. it involves diplomatic relations
between two countries--

510
00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:13.417
So you need more time?

511
00:50:22.708 --> 00:50:24.292
-Very well.
-Hafsyam?

512
00:50:26.250 --> 00:50:28.917
Hafsyam! Hello? Did we lose him?

513
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.083
No. ma'am.

514
00:50:30.333 --> 00:50:31.542
Hafsyam?

515
00:50:35.208 --> 00:50:36.833
Hafsyam! Saif!

516
00:50:37.625 --> 00:50:39.417
You. waterboy. get up.

517
00:50:40.583 --> 00:50:42.625
You forked tongue liar. get up!

518
00:50:43.833 --> 00:50:46.333
I won't repeat myself. Get up!

519
00:50:46.417 --> 00:50:47.292
Sir!

520
00:50:47.625 --> 00:50:49.375
Sir! Please. sir!

521
00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:51.833
Sir. please!

522
00:50:52.333 --> 00:50:55.250
-Sir. please. Take me instead. please!
-I'll do anything you want.

523
00:50:55.333 --> 00:50:56.833
I'll do it now!

524
00:50:56.917 --> 00:50:58.333
You don't have to do this. Saif!

525
00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:00.583
Dad!

526
00:51:01.625 --> 00:51:02.792
Dad!

527
00:51:07.208 --> 00:51:08.958
-Please!
-Have mercy on us!

528
00:51:09.042 --> 00:51:10.625
-Please.
-Pity us!

529
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.125
You said you need more time?

530
00:51:24.792 --> 00:51:26.542
Now you have two hours.

531
00:51:46.542 --> 00:51:47.417
Sit!

532
00:52:04.708 --> 00:52:08.000
Five guards at the main door.
Three by the hostage hall.

533
00:52:08.958 --> 00:52:10.375
There's another problem.

534
00:52:11.125 --> 00:52:12.083
That.

535
00:52:16.292 --> 00:52:18.750
-No way.
-A radar with a five-kilometer radius.

536
00:52:19.375 --> 00:52:22.625
It detects all movement.
There's no way out.

537
00:52:27.625 --> 00:52:29.292
We need to inform the headquarters.

538
00:52:29.917 --> 00:52:31.042
How?

539
00:52:31.708 --> 00:52:33.458
All phone lines are down.

540
00:52:38.333 --> 00:52:39.667
There's a way.

541
00:52:40.333 --> 00:52:42.417
We can't negotiate with this psychopath.

542
00:52:44.333 --> 00:52:45.333
Maarof.

543
00:52:46.208 --> 00:52:47.625
Our infiltration plan.

544
00:52:48.250 --> 00:52:49.625
Can't we go in earlier?

545
00:52:52.375 --> 00:52:55.167
Yes. ma'am. But I must warn you this.

546
00:52:55.333 --> 00:52:57.958
We expect a 20 to 25 percent
casualty rate.

547
00:52:58.792 --> 00:53:01.375
I suggest we send a recon team first.

548
00:53:01.583 --> 00:53:03.000
For what. Maarof?

549
00:53:03.083 --> 00:53:05.417
Do you think he won't kill anyone
in these two hours?

550
00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:08.000
Yes. but we don't know their capacity.

551
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:10.583
We cannot just ambush. ma'am.

552
00:53:12.208 --> 00:53:13.125
Ma'am.

553
00:53:13.625 --> 00:53:16.208
If he realizes that we won't give in.

554
00:53:16.292 --> 00:53:18.500
won't it get worse if we don't act fast?

555
00:53:29.417 --> 00:53:31.375
If we ambush now.

556
00:53:32.542 --> 00:53:33.917
people may die.

557
00:53:35.667 --> 00:53:37.167
But if we wait.

558
00:53:38.958 --> 00:53:41.167
we don't know what will happen.

559
00:53:44.625 --> 00:53:45.708
Okay.

560
00:53:46.625 --> 00:53:48.458
He refused to negotiate. right?

561
00:53:49.792 --> 00:53:50.875
Fine.

562
00:53:53.042 --> 00:53:55.250
Send our unit in now.

563
00:54:15.542 --> 00:54:16.792
Zairi. come in.

564
00:54:36.458 --> 00:54:38.958
You scum. You brought the cops here!

565
00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:48.625
Najr!

566
00:54:50.833 --> 00:54:53.500
Enough Najr! Enough!

567
00:54:53.583 --> 00:54:56.833
Hey. I said stop! That's enough!

568
00:54:56.917 --> 00:54:59.167
Don't you see. Saif? My brother was shot!

569
00:54:59.250 --> 00:55:01.708
-But no one heard a thing!
-Enough!

570
00:55:04.333 --> 00:55:06.708
We will find your brother's killer.

571
00:55:08.375 --> 00:55:11.458
but not by acting like a deranged bitch!

572
00:55:11.542 --> 00:55:14.042
Don't forget our purpose here!

573
00:55:14.792 --> 00:55:16.167
What is going on there?

574
00:55:19.875 --> 00:55:23.458
I think only one man
can drive someone so crazy.

575
00:55:26.667 --> 00:55:27.792
Try again.

576
00:55:29.417 --> 00:55:30.417
Still nothing.

577
00:55:31.250 --> 00:55:32.625
What on earth?

578
00:55:33.208 --> 00:55:34.708
Everything is plugged in.

579
00:55:35.583 --> 00:55:36.917
Try to check the "sekring."

580
00:55:38.417 --> 00:55:40.083
I mean the fuse. over here.

581
00:55:40.708 --> 00:55:42.000
Fuse.

582
00:55:46.792 --> 00:55:48.292
Almost five clicks. ma'am.

583
00:55:49.083 --> 00:55:50.792
Saif. there's an incoming boat.

584
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:54.875
Check it.

585
00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:57.917
We're connected.

586
00:56:06.833 --> 00:56:09.292
Abrar. take your men there.

587
00:56:09.375 --> 00:56:10.958
Khalif. you take the other side.

588
00:56:11.042 --> 00:56:12.917
Najr. you take the far side.

589
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.292
-Saif. come in.
-Come in.

590
00:56:15.375 --> 00:56:18.042
Something's wrong. The Telco tower is lit.

591
00:56:19.167 --> 00:56:21.208
Check the battery. it might overload.

592
00:56:21.542 --> 00:56:24.000
Plug out all cables except the phone wire.

593
00:56:24.083 --> 00:56:25.125
It's the yellow one.

594
00:56:25.667 --> 00:56:27.458
It's 999. what's your emergency?

595
00:56:28.417 --> 00:56:29.792
Go take a look. Najr.

596
00:56:29.875 --> 00:56:31.167
Get them before the cops arrive.

597
00:56:32.250 --> 00:56:33.667
Everyone else. stick to the plan.

598
00:56:45.833 --> 00:56:46.958
Sani. something's up.

599
00:56:50.417 --> 00:56:51.500
I have a plan.

600
00:57:11.417 --> 00:57:13.667
Ma'am. we've got an emergency call.

601
00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:16.250
It's a police officer from IPD Kuantan.

602
00:57:16.333 --> 00:57:18.417
He says he's on the island.

603
00:57:19.125 --> 00:57:20.583
How did he reach us?

604
00:57:20.667 --> 00:57:23.833
Through emergency hotline.
His ID details are valid.

605
00:57:28.958 --> 00:57:30.833
This is SAC Azizat Mansur.

606
00:57:30.917 --> 00:57:34.000
Ma'am. I'm Inspector Khairul Salleh.
Narcotics. Kuantan IPD.

607
00:57:34.083 --> 00:57:35.958
They have a trap here.

608
00:57:36.083 --> 00:57:37.750
What do you mean?

609
00:57:37.833 --> 00:57:39.000
They have radars.

610
00:57:39.083 --> 00:57:41.125
If you send anyone in.

611
00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:42.708
they will know.

612
00:57:43.792 --> 00:57:45.208
Contact our unit now.

613
00:57:56.167 --> 00:58:00.125
Janggut Hitam to Janggut Putih.
We're at East Sector.

614
00:58:01.083 --> 00:58:03.958
Roger. We're en route to North Sector.

615
00:58:04.667 --> 00:58:07.500
Ma'am. radio silence.
We cannot reach them.

616
00:58:07.583 --> 00:58:10.000
Satellite phone? Have you tried that?

617
00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:12.458
What do I do now. ma'am?

618
00:58:14.208 --> 00:58:17.125
What you need to do
is drop that phone now!

619
00:58:17.333 --> 00:58:19.250
-Inspector!
-We're disconnected.

620
00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:21.667
We tried using the satellite phone
but to no avail.

621
00:58:25.625 --> 00:58:26.708
Are you alone?

622
00:58:33.417 --> 00:58:34.833
-I'm alone.
-Don't lie!

623
00:58:36.583 --> 00:58:38.042
Turn around slowly!

624
00:58:44.333 --> 00:58:45.708
Drop your weapon!

625
00:58:51.958 --> 00:58:54.792
I said I'm alone!
What the hell are you waiting for?

626
00:58:54.875 --> 00:58:55.875
Drop it!

627
00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:10.125
Our guests are here.

628
00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:22.833
Stay down!

629
00:59:23.458 --> 00:59:24.375
Blue house!

630
00:59:35.333 --> 00:59:36.333
Cover me!

631
00:59:38.542 --> 00:59:39.583
Janggut Putih!

632
00:59:39.667 --> 00:59:41.750
We need backup! Taking heavy fire!

633
00:59:41.833 --> 00:59:43.250
Okay. chief! We'll be right there!

634
00:59:44.875 --> 00:59:46.583
Contact at 12!

635
00:59:47.167 --> 00:59:49.083
Contact at 12!

636
01:00:05.792 --> 01:00:06.625
Zali!

637
01:00:08.792 --> 01:00:09.792
Zali!

638
01:00:16.708 --> 01:00:17.583
Man!

639
01:00:39.875 --> 01:00:40.917
Where?

640
01:00:41.792 --> 01:00:42.833
Damn it!

641
01:00:50.958 --> 01:00:51.875
Blue house!

642
01:00:52.042 --> 01:00:53.125
I'll take him!

643
01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:16.375
Damn it!

644
01:01:25.375 --> 01:01:27.417
Don't do anything stupid. Dan!

645
01:01:27.542 --> 01:01:29.125
Stay here! Don't move!

646
01:01:29.208 --> 01:01:31.500
I can fight! This is my choice. not yours!

647
01:01:31.583 --> 01:01:34.000
You! Quiet!

648
01:01:34.083 --> 01:01:37.042
Me? He's noisy not me!

649
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.333
What the hell?

650
01:01:39.417 --> 01:01:42.292
You're going to get us all killed!

651
01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:45.083
Hey. do you hear me? I said shut up!

652
01:01:45.167 --> 01:01:48.917
-Sit down!
-Sit here like a coward? Like you?

653
01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.625
Hey. sit down! Do you want to die?

654
01:01:52.708 --> 01:01:55.500
This is the first time
I'm agreeing with a criminal.

655
01:01:57.292 --> 01:01:59.333
Dan. please. Sit down.

656
01:01:59.417 --> 01:02:01.708
And wait for what? For you to speak up?

657
01:02:01.792 --> 01:02:02.917
What do you want to say?

658
01:02:03.292 --> 01:02:04.375
I say...

659
01:02:04.458 --> 01:02:05.375
Now!

660
01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:09.583
Saif!

661
01:02:20.667 --> 01:02:22.667
Put your hands up!

662
01:02:23.875 --> 01:02:26.792
Listen to me.
Tell them to drop their guns.

663
01:02:26.875 --> 01:02:28.625
Your fight is over!

664
01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:30.875
Drop your weapons!

665
01:02:31.125 --> 01:02:33.083
If I don't. what would you do?

666
01:02:33.167 --> 01:02:35.333
-Don't test me.
-I dare you. Shoot me.

667
01:02:35.417 --> 01:02:36.292
I said drop it!

668
01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:56.167
We're cops.

669
01:02:58.958 --> 01:03:01.250
We've spoken to Dato' Azizat
from the headquarters.

670
01:03:02.542 --> 01:03:04.875
We're here to help. Okay?

671
01:03:05.250 --> 01:03:06.292
Where are the rest?

672
01:03:07.875 --> 01:03:08.875
Where are they?

673
01:03:26.042 --> 01:03:27.292
They're surrounded.

674
01:03:29.792 --> 01:03:30.958
Follow me.

675
01:03:32.542 --> 01:03:35.125
Do you think these men are my slaves?

676
01:03:35.417 --> 01:03:37.542
They're slaves to my agenda.

677
01:03:38.042 --> 01:03:39.458
They're crusaders.

678
01:03:40.917 --> 01:03:46.458
They've vowed to die as martyrs
than to live another second in this world.

679
01:03:56.542 --> 01:03:59.125
-Wait here and keep a lookout.
-Okay.

680
01:04:10.083 --> 01:04:11.417
Damn it. Khai!

681
01:04:23.125 --> 01:04:24.292
I have an idea.

682
01:04:50.292 --> 01:04:51.333
Come on!

683
01:04:57.292 --> 01:04:59.292
-You want me to take it?
-I'll do it.

684
01:05:32.667 --> 01:05:34.458
Chief! The backdoor's clear!

685
01:05:34.542 --> 01:05:36.125
Okay. Everyone out!

686
01:05:45.917 --> 01:05:47.958
Don't shoot!

687
01:05:49.292 --> 01:05:50.542
We're cops.

688
01:05:51.708 --> 01:05:53.500
Drop your guns!

689
01:05:54.458 --> 01:05:55.792
If you surrender.

690
01:05:55.875 --> 01:05:59.167
you'll betray me and our cause.

691
01:06:00.458 --> 01:06:02.750
Sir. what do we do?

692
01:06:04.958 --> 01:06:07.083
-So you're cops?
-Shut up!

693
01:06:08.833 --> 01:06:11.875
Let's shake things up a bit.
Shall we. sir?

694
01:06:13.083 --> 01:06:17.458
My dear warriors.
aim your weapons at the hostages.

695
01:06:17.667 --> 01:06:19.542
Hey!

696
01:06:21.875 --> 01:06:26.542
You can drop your weapons.
or go ahead and shoot me instead.

697
01:06:26.917 --> 01:06:29.833
These hostages' lives are in your hand.
What say you?

698
01:06:30.667 --> 01:06:32.667
Decide. then. I'll count to ten.

699
01:06:35.083 --> 01:06:36.208
One.

700
01:06:37.333 --> 01:06:38.458
-Two.
-What are you doing?

701
01:06:38.542 --> 01:06:39.375
Three.

702
01:06:39.875 --> 01:06:41.000
Four.

703
01:06:41.125 --> 01:06:42.667
-Five.
-Sir?

704
01:06:42.750 --> 01:06:43.917
Six.

705
01:06:45.083 --> 01:06:46.125
Seven.

706
01:06:53.458 --> 01:06:56.000
I only counted to seven.

707
01:06:57.417 --> 01:06:59.958
The Royal Malaysian Police.
you guys are impressive.

708
01:07:01.583 --> 01:07:03.042
Dan! Dan!

709
01:07:03.708 --> 01:07:05.083
Dan!

710
01:07:05.167 --> 01:07:06.375
Behold!

711
01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:11.333
Behold the sacrifices your cops make

712
01:07:11.417 --> 01:07:13.292
for the people and country!

713
01:07:15.167 --> 01:07:16.542
We're no different. you and I.

714
01:07:18.250 --> 01:07:19.875
We both have principles.

715
01:07:20.333 --> 01:07:22.875
You have your convictions as a cop.

716
01:07:24.833 --> 01:07:25.833
And me.

717
01:07:27.583 --> 01:07:30.333
-my greater purpose.
-You and I are not the same!

718
01:07:30.417 --> 01:07:31.958
Your place is in hell!

719
01:07:32.042 --> 01:07:34.458
And you're sure yours is in heaven?

720
01:07:35.792 --> 01:07:37.917
If I really belong in hell.

721
01:07:39.333 --> 01:07:43.208
why in the God's will
am I the one standing.

722
01:07:43.667 --> 01:07:44.875
while you're on your knees?

723
01:07:56.833 --> 01:07:57.833
Don't worry.

724
01:07:59.375 --> 01:08:01.542
You put a gun to my head.

725
01:08:02.250 --> 01:08:05.083
You gave me a chance to prove my faith.

726
01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.083
Now I'll return the favor.

727
01:08:13.958 --> 01:08:17.042
Pull the trigger.
and I will let everyone go.

728
01:08:17.583 --> 01:08:20.792
including this little dog beside you.

729
01:08:21.458 --> 01:08:22.500
I'm sorry.

730
01:08:22.625 --> 01:08:26.250
You took an oath to protect lives

731
01:08:26.333 --> 01:08:27.750
and save people.

732
01:08:27.833 --> 01:08:30.083
I admit I was wrong. I'm sorry.

733
01:08:30.167 --> 01:08:33.250
You did nothing wrong.
Not even one mistake.

734
01:08:33.333 --> 01:08:35.375
It's your job. keep at it.

735
01:08:35.458 --> 01:08:37.458
Finish the job!

736
01:08:37.542 --> 01:08:39.750
Don't do this. Let us all go.

737
01:08:39.833 --> 01:08:41.167
Please.

738
01:08:42.417 --> 01:08:45.417
Pull the trigger.

739
01:08:47.292 --> 01:08:49.250
Pull the trigger!

740
01:09:14.583 --> 01:09:15.708
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

741
01:09:16.958 --> 01:09:18.083
We're nothing alike.

742
01:09:19.125 --> 01:09:21.750
Your principles aren't comparable to mine.

743
01:09:26.417 --> 01:09:28.417
Chuck him with the rest of the bodies.

744
01:09:28.542 --> 01:09:29.875
We might need him later.

745
01:09:35.042 --> 01:09:36.083
Yes. ma'am.

746
01:09:36.583 --> 01:09:39.417
Five operatives were killed.
One is critical.

747
01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.625
Any other way to get us out?

748
01:09:43.875 --> 01:09:44.750
Put pressure on it.

749
01:09:49.625 --> 01:09:50.625
Understood. ma'am.

750
01:10:02.458 --> 01:10:03.500
There's no extraction.

751
01:10:04.958 --> 01:10:08.542
We're ordered to sit tight and wait.

752
01:10:09.292 --> 01:10:10.250
Arshad!

753
01:10:10.625 --> 01:10:11.750
Arshad! Mikael!

754
01:10:11.833 --> 01:10:12.792
Arshad!

755
01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.917
Wake up. Arshad!

756
01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.875
Arshad!

757
01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:19.542
Damn it!

758
01:10:40.750 --> 01:10:42.333
There's an incoming call from the island.

759
01:10:47.958 --> 01:10:50.500
Do you know the traits of a hypocrite?

760
01:10:52.458 --> 01:10:56.042
A hypocrite breaks a promise.

761
01:10:57.667 --> 01:11:01.667
You know what I want.
and I have given you enough time.

762
01:11:02.333 --> 01:11:05.208
Saif. I can explain. We just wanted to--

763
01:11:05.292 --> 01:11:09.417
Listen up.
You have betrayed all these people!

764
01:11:09.917 --> 01:11:12.583
Now. pay attention!

765
01:11:13.375 --> 01:11:14.625
Our agreement has changed.

766
01:11:16.583 --> 01:11:19.417
I'll give you two more hours.
After that. I will kill everyone!

767
01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:20.375
Saif.

768
01:11:20.458 --> 01:11:21.917
Let me... Saif?

769
01:11:22.458 --> 01:11:23.958
-Saif.
-We're disconnected. ma'am.

770
01:11:26.583 --> 01:11:28.542
Tell Abrar to set up the bombs.

771
01:11:28.917 --> 01:11:32.167
Unless we teach them a lesson.
they will keep messing with us.

772
01:11:36.083 --> 01:11:37.042
Saif!

773
01:11:58.667 --> 01:12:01.583
Saif. they got away.

774
01:12:01.917 --> 01:12:03.667
They took our weapons and radio.

775
01:12:08.792 --> 01:12:10.042
Why are you here?

776
01:12:12.833 --> 01:12:15.292
-My work here is not done.
-Precisely!

777
01:12:18.625 --> 01:12:21.292
Your work here is absolutely not done.

778
01:12:24.333 --> 01:12:27.458
Do you not see the will of Messiah?

779
01:12:29.375 --> 01:12:32.542
You should have been dead.

780
01:12:32.917 --> 01:12:34.625
Yet here you are. breathing.

781
01:12:36.167 --> 01:12:38.417
I won't stop until they're all dead!

782
01:12:40.625 --> 01:12:42.667
Revenge has made you weak. Najr.

783
01:12:43.625 --> 01:12:46.708
Now's the time to be strong.
Rise from the ashes!

784
01:12:46.792 --> 01:12:51.042
Prove to Messiah
why you deserve this second chance.

785
01:12:54.417 --> 01:12:55.417
Fix him up.

786
01:13:03.583 --> 01:13:04.583
Rafael.

787
01:13:06.375 --> 01:13:08.333
Change all walkie frequencies.

788
01:13:20.125 --> 01:13:23.417
I was at a briefing
for a regional operation.

789
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.375
There was a Malaysian.
His ring was like yours.

790
01:13:29.208 --> 01:13:31.958
This is not mine. I just take care of it.

791
01:13:34.083 --> 01:13:35.792
Why do you believe me?

792
01:13:37.250 --> 01:13:41.042
Your friend was so eager to lock me up.

793
01:13:41.125 --> 01:13:42.500
I didn't say I believe you.

794
01:13:46.250 --> 01:13:48.125
I guess I want to believe you.

795
01:13:49.875 --> 01:13:51.000
Meaning?

796
01:13:56.750 --> 01:13:59.958
I got this ring a day
before the owner went undercover.

797
01:14:00.458 --> 01:14:01.833
He asked me to keep it.

798
01:14:04.542 --> 01:14:07.958
Three years in a drug syndicate.
and he never came back.

799
01:14:09.792 --> 01:14:11.292
Before we knew it. he was hooked.

800
01:14:13.625 --> 01:14:17.083
When the headquarters pulled him out.
he was in bad shape.

801
01:14:19.583 --> 01:14:20.583
Addicted.

802
01:14:25.875 --> 01:14:27.375
I believe that like him.

803
01:14:28.667 --> 01:14:30.708
you must have your reasons too.

804
01:14:35.708 --> 01:14:36.917
Your old partner?

805
01:14:44.583 --> 01:14:45.792
You could say so.

806
01:14:48.333 --> 01:14:49.792
How is he now?

807
01:14:55.375 --> 01:14:56.375
He was shot.

808
01:15:00.417 --> 01:15:01.542
Sorry.

809
01:15:02.042 --> 01:15:04.667
Bad things keep happening on this date.

810
01:15:06.208 --> 01:15:08.542
Nothing I do is ever right.

811
01:15:12.833 --> 01:15:14.083
I suppose this day is cursed.

812
01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.250
The day is not over.

813
01:15:20.667 --> 01:15:22.208
There's still time.

814
01:15:35.333 --> 01:15:36.333
Are you guys hungry?

815
01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:38.958
No. thank you.

816
01:15:40.792 --> 01:15:41.708
Take it.

817
01:15:44.542 --> 01:15:45.500
Thank you.

818
01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.208
Hello there.

819
01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:58.375
Greetings to the two cops
wandering around out there.

820
01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:05.708
-Are you infidels?
-Syam.

821
01:16:13.292 --> 01:16:14.833
Hello there.

822
01:16:19.208 --> 01:16:20.333
Hello.

823
01:16:21.625 --> 01:16:23.833
That's more like it.

824
01:16:26.125 --> 01:16:29.708
I've killed one of your friends.
I have one more with me now.

825
01:16:32.083 --> 01:16:33.333
The one with the big nose.

826
01:16:33.792 --> 01:16:35.250
Listen to me. you prick.

827
01:16:35.458 --> 01:16:38.500
-If you lift a finger--
-Listen to me first.

828
01:16:38.583 --> 01:16:40.375
What are you fussing around out there?

829
01:16:43.417 --> 01:16:46.417
You know you can't stop me.

830
01:16:48.167 --> 01:16:49.292
Am I right?

831
01:16:53.250 --> 01:16:55.333
Am I talking to the wall?

832
01:16:58.875 --> 01:17:01.083
-I'm listening.
-You listen but don't answer.

833
01:17:01.208 --> 01:17:02.958
What the hell do you want?

834
01:17:04.083 --> 01:17:05.458
The hell do I want?

835
01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.250
I like bold people like you.

836
01:17:08.708 --> 01:17:12.917
Unlike your friend here

837
01:17:13.042 --> 01:17:14.958
who tries too hard to be a cop.

838
01:17:17.375 --> 01:17:18.667
You have two options.

839
01:17:19.208 --> 01:17:22.208
Surrender. and your friend will be spared.

840
01:17:24.667 --> 01:17:25.667
Or?

841
01:17:26.458 --> 01:17:33.417
I will toss your friend's body
all around this island

842
01:17:33.625 --> 01:17:39.708
so that you can pick it up piece by piece.

843
01:17:43.458 --> 01:17:44.708
I'll think about it.

844
01:17:55.625 --> 01:17:56.875
We have to do something.

845
01:17:57.500 --> 01:17:59.000
Our orders are to stand down.

846
01:18:01.708 --> 01:18:02.875
Let me speak to Dato' Azizat.

847
01:18:03.958 --> 01:18:06.417
Inspector Khairul. please calm down.

848
01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:08.250
Didn't you hear what he just said?

849
01:18:10.083 --> 01:18:13.750
He's going to kill my partner at any time!

850
01:18:25.292 --> 01:18:26.625
My partner is a cop.

851
01:18:27.333 --> 01:18:29.833
Just like me. just like you guys.

852
01:18:30.875 --> 01:18:32.917
Are we just going to let him die?

853
01:18:40.292 --> 01:18:42.792
I should've left you to die just now.

854
01:18:46.583 --> 01:18:51.208
Ma'am. I want to discuss our next steps.

855
01:18:52.458 --> 01:18:56.083
My partner is held hostage
with a lot more others.

856
01:18:56.292 --> 01:18:57.958
I don't know what your plans are.

857
01:18:58.792 --> 01:19:02.917
But as long as they have that radar.
there's only one end to this story.

858
01:19:03.833 --> 01:19:06.958
Inspector.
we don't negotiate with terrorists.

859
01:19:07.042 --> 01:19:08.292
We have principles.

860
01:19:08.375 --> 01:19:10.542
-You understand?
-For saving lives?

861
01:19:11.458 --> 01:19:13.042
Do we use the same principle for that?

862
01:19:19.167 --> 01:19:23.667
My point is there are six of us.
Why not send us in?

863
01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.375
Send you in for what? To die?

864
01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:28.083
That's not what I am insinuating.

865
01:19:28.792 --> 01:19:31.250
-We give what they want.
-We don't compromise--

866
01:19:31.333 --> 01:19:35.750
Yes. ma'am. We let them think
that they're getting what they want.

867
01:19:35.833 --> 01:19:37.833
Once they're distracted.

868
01:19:37.917 --> 01:19:39.542
we can move in quietly.

869
01:19:39.667 --> 01:19:41.292
Then you send an assault team.

870
01:19:41.667 --> 01:19:43.458
We'll defend the hostages from the inside.

871
01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:47.875
Inspector Khairul.

872
01:19:48.583 --> 01:19:51.500
I must admit that you're brave.

873
01:19:58.375 --> 01:20:00.250
But there's just six of you.

874
01:20:00.542 --> 01:20:02.750
Including your partner. seven.

875
01:20:03.208 --> 01:20:04.167
While they have--

876
01:20:04.250 --> 01:20:07.833
A lot more will die
if we don't do anything.

877
01:20:23.917 --> 01:20:27.042
But I cannot order you all
to take such a big risk.

878
01:20:28.333 --> 01:20:30.042
If you really want to go in.

879
01:20:34.208 --> 01:20:35.375
you have to voluntarily do it.

880
01:21:14.125 --> 01:21:15.125
Dan?

881
01:21:16.458 --> 01:21:17.417
Dan!

882
01:21:19.292 --> 01:21:20.375
Thank goodness. Dan.

883
01:21:20.708 --> 01:21:21.625
You...

884
01:21:24.583 --> 01:21:25.583
Dan?

885
01:21:31.292 --> 01:21:32.417
I'm dead. sir.

886
01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:35.000
My goodness.

887
01:21:36.792 --> 01:21:37.875
I'm dead.

888
01:21:41.125 --> 01:21:42.083
Why?

889
01:21:46.083 --> 01:21:47.292
Do you fear death. sir?

890
01:22:00.250 --> 01:22:01.542
Didn't you take an oath

891
01:22:03.292 --> 01:22:04.625
to save them?

892
01:22:06.917 --> 01:22:08.625
What happened to your promise?

893
01:22:44.375 --> 01:22:45.958
This isn't only for my friend.

894
01:22:48.667 --> 01:22:51.042
There are 200 people to think about.

895
01:22:51.333 --> 01:22:53.208
If the headquarters try to attack again.

896
01:22:54.417 --> 01:22:58.208
not only will Al-Minas banish.
the hostages will too.

897
01:22:59.042 --> 01:23:00.458
I'm not trying to be a hero.

898
01:23:04.125 --> 01:23:06.875
I just cannot live with myself
if I don't do something.

899
01:23:10.208 --> 01:23:11.250
This is crazy.

900
01:23:11.917 --> 01:23:13.583
I cannot decide for everyone.

901
01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.083
You make your own choice.

902
01:23:18.208 --> 01:23:19.125
Zul?

903
01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:26.333
If we do this.

904
01:23:27.125 --> 01:23:28.708
it's like we're digging our own graves.

905
01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:31.167
There are so few of us left.

906
01:23:34.125 --> 01:23:35.792
But if you're going in.

907
01:23:36.208 --> 01:23:37.625
I'll have your back. sir.

908
01:23:39.458 --> 01:23:40.417
Mikael?

909
01:23:40.500 --> 01:23:43.375
How many more have to die?
You know what I mean. right?

910
01:23:43.708 --> 01:23:47.208
Tonight alone. Sab. Paan. Riko. Kamal.

911
01:23:47.750 --> 01:23:49.125
Syahrul. Arshad.

912
01:23:51.542 --> 01:23:52.917
But then again.

913
01:23:53.833 --> 01:23:55.583
I don't want their deaths to be in vain.

914
01:23:56.875 --> 01:23:57.792
Zali?

915
01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.375
What are we waiting for?

916
01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.250
In all my years of service.

917
01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:09.125
I've never made a decision like this.

918
01:24:10.417 --> 01:24:14.708
But I remember the day I took the oath.

919
01:24:16.167 --> 01:24:17.917
I swore to save lives.

920
01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:24.292
Okay. I'm in.

921
01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:26.125
What about your friend?

922
01:24:28.708 --> 01:24:31.333
My mission was simple.
get Riky and go home.

923
01:24:34.542 --> 01:24:35.750
But now that's on hold.

924
01:24:37.917 --> 01:24:40.125
Promise me. you'll keep your word.

925
01:24:40.208 --> 01:24:41.167
Understood.

926
01:24:41.250 --> 01:24:43.167
Fate has brought us together tonight.

927
01:24:44.042 --> 01:24:46.792
Let's see what fate has in store
for our enemy.

928
01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Zali. suit them up.

929
01:24:49.750 --> 01:24:51.375
Comms. vest. weapons.

930
01:24:51.458 --> 01:24:53.292
-Whatever we have.
-Yes. sir.

931
01:25:08.167 --> 01:25:10.333
Attention. unit leader.

932
01:25:10.708 --> 01:25:13.500
The package will arrive in one hour.

933
01:25:13.792 --> 01:25:15.583
As soon as the package arrives.

934
01:25:15.667 --> 01:25:18.333
the assault team will follow
five clicks behind.

935
01:25:18.417 --> 01:25:21.625
Make sure all the hostages
are secured before they arrive.

936
01:25:22.167 --> 01:25:23.792
Otherwise. many will perish.

937
01:25:26.833 --> 01:25:27.708
I repeat.

938
01:25:34.542 --> 01:25:36.417
As soon as Husyairi arrives.

939
01:25:36.875 --> 01:25:39.750
I want a safe passage out.

940
01:25:40.625 --> 01:25:41.667
If you lie to me.

941
01:25:41.875 --> 01:25:45.083
you will pay.

942
01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:46.667
Yes. Saif.

943
01:25:47.167 --> 01:25:48.417
It's all clear.

944
01:25:49.958 --> 01:25:51.542
Now you listen to me.

945
01:25:51.625 --> 01:25:53.750
Until Husyairi arrives.

946
01:25:53.958 --> 01:25:56.333
if you kill anyone.

947
01:25:56.875 --> 01:25:59.542
I don't care if you have hostages.

948
01:25:59.833 --> 01:26:03.708
I will be the one to make sure
that you pay.

949
01:26:08.333 --> 01:26:09.458
Saif.

950
01:26:09.833 --> 01:26:11.708
Saif. what is this? Saif!

951
01:26:13.583 --> 01:26:15.042
Didn't you say

952
01:26:16.042 --> 01:26:17.333
that your faith is unwavering?

953
01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.208
Your uncle will arrive soon.

954
01:26:24.625 --> 01:26:25.875
Please. Saif.

955
01:26:26.208 --> 01:26:27.083
Saif.

956
01:26:27.167 --> 01:26:30.708
I am more useful if I'm alive!

957
01:26:31.042 --> 01:26:32.167
Please. Saif!

958
01:26:32.542 --> 01:26:34.500
You really are useful. Riky.

959
01:26:37.250 --> 01:26:41.333
Do you remember the story of Abraham?

960
01:26:44.958 --> 01:26:48.875
Only the sacrifice of a kin

961
01:26:49.875 --> 01:26:55.792
can please our God.

962
01:27:05.792 --> 01:27:07.708
You must be proud. Riky.

963
01:27:09.042 --> 01:27:12.667
Your uncle will rise again

964
01:27:13.167 --> 01:27:14.333
because of you.

965
01:27:19.583 --> 01:27:21.333
Take all of his blood.

966
01:27:21.708 --> 01:27:24.833
Don't waste a single drop.

967
01:27:47.083 --> 01:27:49.125
One tango. south block roof.

968
01:27:49.833 --> 01:27:51.042
Another on the east roof.

969
01:27:52.833 --> 01:27:53.792
Take them out.

970
01:27:59.458 --> 01:28:00.375
Okay. move!

971
01:29:01.375 --> 01:29:03.292
Damn it!

972
01:29:04.208 --> 01:29:05.500
Zali. over here.

973
01:29:07.833 --> 01:29:08.917
It's a C-4.

974
01:29:09.083 --> 01:29:10.833
Can you handle it?

975
01:29:15.083 --> 01:29:16.292
No problem. sir.

976
01:29:31.375 --> 01:29:34.750
Rafael. is that the only boat?

977
01:29:34.958 --> 01:29:36.667
Yes. Saif. Just that one.

978
01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:52.583
Sani. are you okay?

979
01:30:03.292 --> 01:30:04.917
He told me to pull the trigger. Khai.

980
01:30:06.250 --> 01:30:07.542
What are you talking about?

981
01:30:13.958 --> 01:30:15.292
It's all my fault. Khai.

982
01:30:18.875 --> 01:30:20.083
I couldn't do it.

983
01:30:20.500 --> 01:30:21.792
I couldn't...

984
01:30:22.958 --> 01:30:24.083
Sani.

985
01:30:24.167 --> 01:30:25.333
Sani. focus.

986
01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:29.000
There are four special forces guys
out there.

987
01:30:29.208 --> 01:30:30.750
The hostages are all secured.

988
01:30:30.833 --> 01:30:33.542
We only have to keep guard
until the assault team arrives.

989
01:30:33.625 --> 01:30:36.875
Sani. I need you right now.

990
01:30:37.833 --> 01:30:39.708
He gave me a choice. Khai.

991
01:30:42.125 --> 01:30:45.792
I could have shot myself
and saved these people.

992
01:30:45.875 --> 01:30:48.667
-But I didn't do anything!
-Goodness. Sani.

993
01:30:48.750 --> 01:30:51.208
He was right. I'm not fit to be a cop.

994
01:30:51.917 --> 01:30:54.833
-I'm not fit to be a cop.
-Don't listen to him.

995
01:30:54.917 --> 01:30:56.250
-Why do you listen to him?
-Khai...

996
01:30:56.333 --> 01:30:57.417
Sani!

997
01:30:58.625 --> 01:31:00.458
Sani. I'm here because...

998
01:31:02.083 --> 01:31:03.625
I'm here because you're my partner.

999
01:31:07.125 --> 01:31:08.042
Khai...

1000
01:31:09.542 --> 01:31:12.167
Look. Khai. Mat Dan is dead.

1001
01:31:13.375 --> 01:31:17.667
He died and I didn't do anything.
I just watched him die.

1002
01:31:19.167 --> 01:31:21.125
He's playing with your head. Sani.

1003
01:31:21.792 --> 01:31:24.500
Do you think if you pulled the trigger.
he would release them?

1004
01:31:25.042 --> 01:31:26.250
That's what you think!

1005
01:31:26.375 --> 01:31:28.458
That's what he wants you to think!

1006
01:31:32.375 --> 01:31:34.000
Get up!

1007
01:31:35.625 --> 01:31:36.917
-Khai!
-Get up!

1008
01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.083
-Leave me alone! Go!
-Get up!

1009
01:31:42.375 --> 01:31:44.667
You don't get it. Khai!

1010
01:31:47.375 --> 01:31:49.708
These people died in front of me.

1011
01:31:50.292 --> 01:31:52.083
And I didn't do anything.

1012
01:31:52.167 --> 01:31:54.750
I just watched them die! I just watched!

1013
01:31:56.875 --> 01:31:58.625
I'm completely useless!

1014
01:32:01.083 --> 01:32:03.958
Many more will die
if we don't do anything now.

1015
01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.708
Please get up. Sani. Please.

1016
01:32:08.167 --> 01:32:09.250
Khai!

1017
01:32:10.458 --> 01:32:11.792
You don't get it!

1018
01:32:13.333 --> 01:32:14.500
What did I say?

1019
01:32:16.250 --> 01:32:17.875
You don't understand.

1020
01:32:20.875 --> 01:32:24.542
You were not here.
You don't know how it feels.

1021
01:32:24.792 --> 01:32:28.208
My younger brother died
right in front of me!

1022
01:32:28.583 --> 01:32:31.833
That's not all.
I was the one who shot him!

1023
01:32:31.917 --> 01:32:35.917
I'm reminded of what I did every day!

1024
01:32:47.250 --> 01:32:49.458
This is our job. What can we do?

1025
01:32:49.750 --> 01:32:52.875
We take on the worst when others can't.

1026
01:32:52.958 --> 01:32:55.250
It's a cruel world and you know it.

1027
01:32:57.333 --> 01:32:58.583
We endure it.

1028
01:32:58.833 --> 01:33:00.292
We soak it all up.

1029
01:33:00.375 --> 01:33:03.417
Who will clean it up if not us?

1030
01:33:07.250 --> 01:33:10.750
Sani. if I didn't do that.
my mom would have died.

1031
01:33:10.833 --> 01:33:12.708
Even I would have been dead too!

1032
01:33:13.042 --> 01:33:14.792
You're well aware of all this!

1033
01:33:29.042 --> 01:33:30.417
Do you still remember this tool?

1034
01:33:34.625 --> 01:33:35.833
When you're ready.

1035
01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:39.125
find me.

1036
01:34:08.833 --> 01:34:09.917
Sir.

1037
01:34:11.750 --> 01:34:13.208
This tool has no conscience.

1038
01:34:14.542 --> 01:34:16.000
Criminals use it too.

1039
01:34:19.792 --> 01:34:22.792
But for us cops.

1040
01:34:24.958 --> 01:34:26.292
what is this tool for?

1041
01:34:38.250 --> 01:34:39.333
Your partner?

1042
01:34:43.125 --> 01:34:44.333
We can just proceed.

1043
01:34:45.625 --> 01:34:47.042
Let's clear the rest.

1044
01:34:47.625 --> 01:34:48.875
There's another problem.

1045
01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:52.750
The west side looks busy.
There are two tangos outside.

1046
01:34:53.375 --> 01:34:55.292
I'm sure there's more inside.

1047
01:34:55.583 --> 01:34:56.958
There's one on the roof.

1048
01:34:57.875 --> 01:34:59.125
North-west block.

1049
01:35:00.917 --> 01:35:02.333
Can't we take them down from here?

1050
01:35:02.708 --> 01:35:04.000
No. Too risky.

1051
01:35:04.708 --> 01:35:06.542
We don't know how many there are inside.

1052
01:35:07.833 --> 01:35:09.208
What if we go around the building?

1053
01:35:09.708 --> 01:35:10.792
That could work.

1054
01:35:11.208 --> 01:35:12.542
We can clear the inside first.

1055
01:35:14.667 --> 01:35:15.750
It's too far.

1056
01:35:16.667 --> 01:35:17.958
They can spot us anytime.

1057
01:35:19.917 --> 01:35:20.958
There's another way.

1058
01:35:27.417 --> 01:35:29.750
Help. sir! The rope is loose!

1059
01:35:30.208 --> 01:35:31.792
-Stop! Don't move!
-The rope. sir.

1060
01:35:31.875 --> 01:35:34.333
It came off. Please tie it back!

1061
01:35:35.125 --> 01:35:38.042
Please tie it back! Tie it for me!

1062
01:35:38.375 --> 01:35:39.750
I'll shoot you!

1063
01:35:40.458 --> 01:35:43.250
Are you crazy? Saif wants him alive!

1064
01:35:46.833 --> 01:35:48.917
-North-west block clear.
-Let's go!

1065
01:35:49.917 --> 01:35:51.583
Looks like he's gone crazy.

1066
01:35:51.958 --> 01:35:54.583
I want food. Do you have any food?

1067
01:36:05.833 --> 01:36:07.708
Please tie this back.

1068
01:36:07.792 --> 01:36:10.125
I don't want to get scolded
when they see my hands like this.

1069
01:36:10.208 --> 01:36:12.792
Saif really drove him insane.

1070
01:36:27.083 --> 01:36:28.125
Hey!

1071
01:36:28.625 --> 01:36:30.167
Is someone messing with your brain?

1072
01:36:31.375 --> 01:36:33.292
With my brain? Yes. there is.

1073
01:36:33.833 --> 01:36:35.500
Oh. really? Who?

1074
01:36:36.250 --> 01:36:37.917
-Your mom.
-You punk!

1075
01:36:49.750 --> 01:36:50.708
Mikael.

1076
01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:53.833
Zul. Zali. We head north-west. now.

1077
01:37:09.167 --> 01:37:10.250
Give me a hand.

1078
01:37:18.958 --> 01:37:20.042
Don't die on me.

1079
01:37:21.292 --> 01:37:22.208
Get up!

1080
01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:26.292
Tell them you were working with Adli.

1081
01:37:27.667 --> 01:37:28.750
Tell them.

1082
01:37:28.958 --> 01:37:31.583
Tell them you were working with Adli.

1083
01:37:31.875 --> 01:37:34.625
Get up! Tell them everything!

1084
01:37:34.708 --> 01:37:36.000
-Rian.
-Get up!

1085
01:37:37.792 --> 01:37:38.792
Get up!

1086
01:37:41.750 --> 01:37:42.708
Get up!

1087
01:37:44.042 --> 01:37:45.042
Get up!

1088
01:37:45.375 --> 01:37:46.375
Rian.

1089
01:37:47.458 --> 01:37:50.292
Get up!

1090
01:37:50.500 --> 01:37:52.083
-Get up!
-Enough!

1091
01:37:52.292 --> 01:37:53.333
That's enough.

1092
01:37:55.250 --> 01:37:56.208
Enough.

1093
01:37:56.875 --> 01:37:57.750
Enough.

1094
01:38:21.500 --> 01:38:23.542
Rian. I'm sorry.

1095
01:38:26.583 --> 01:38:27.875
You were right about Adli.

1096
01:38:29.667 --> 01:38:30.792
Here's the proof.

1097
01:38:31.625 --> 01:38:32.667
Keep it safe.

1098
01:38:33.833 --> 01:38:35.667
This proves your innocence.

1099
01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:38.333
GET OUT NOW!

1100
01:38:42.167 --> 01:38:44.917
Rengau Main.
The package arrives in five minutes.

1101
01:38:45.333 --> 01:38:46.500
Take your positions.

1102
01:38:58.167 --> 01:38:59.875
We have secured the hostages.

1103
01:39:00.208 --> 01:39:02.458
I repeat. The hostages are secured.

1104
01:39:05.625 --> 01:39:07.500
The assault team is on the move.

1105
01:39:07.583 --> 01:39:08.875
ETA. 30 minutes.

1106
01:39:09.167 --> 01:39:11.208
Good luck. Rengau Main.

1107
01:39:15.875 --> 01:39:16.875
Thirty minutes.

1108
01:39:17.250 --> 01:39:19.500
That's a long time. You sure we can hold?

1109
01:39:26.083 --> 01:39:27.208
They're coming.

1110
01:39:44.042 --> 01:39:45.333
We have to hurry!

1111
01:39:47.333 --> 01:39:48.583
Help untie the rest.

1112
01:39:51.667 --> 01:39:53.250
Get everyone into the room.

1113
01:39:54.167 --> 01:39:55.375
Help the others.

1114
01:39:59.833 --> 01:40:01.500
Keep your head down.

1115
01:40:01.750 --> 01:40:02.917
Keep your head down.

1116
01:40:44.292 --> 01:40:46.792
All of you will testify this today!

1117
01:40:49.917 --> 01:40:55.083
This is a testament
that God is pleased with our fight!

1118
01:40:56.708 --> 01:40:58.542
Saif. something's wrong.

1119
01:41:01.583 --> 01:41:02.750
There is a bomb!

1120
01:41:09.667 --> 01:41:10.625
Now!

1121
01:41:23.083 --> 01:41:24.917
Najr!

1122
01:41:48.375 --> 01:41:50.417
Ma'am. Hafsyam's on the line.

1123
01:41:50.667 --> 01:41:52.458
Leave it. Don't pick up.

1124
01:41:58.958 --> 01:42:00.250
Listen. my fellow brothers.

1125
01:42:01.167 --> 01:42:03.042
They are screwing with us!

1126
01:42:04.083 --> 01:42:08.542
We will not let these infidel punks
insult our religion!

1127
01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.417
Split up and move out!

1128
01:42:11.750 --> 01:42:16.917
And we will send these dogs back to hell!

1129
01:42:17.083 --> 01:42:19.833
We will fight until we breathe our last!

1130
01:42:22.792 --> 01:42:23.833
Saif!

1131
01:42:34.750 --> 01:42:36.917
-Left side!
-Left side!

1132
01:42:41.875 --> 01:42:44.208
Khai. it's full. There's no more space.

1133
01:42:51.625 --> 01:42:54.083
For now. stay down.
Keep your heads low. Stay low.

1134
01:42:55.292 --> 01:42:57.875
Listen up. You. you and you. follow me.

1135
01:43:00.250 --> 01:43:02.792
Stay low. Stay calm.
I'll be right here to protect you.

1136
01:43:18.917 --> 01:43:22.083
Here! Take these. Make a barricade.

1137
01:43:22.625 --> 01:43:23.792
Hurry!

1138
01:43:30.083 --> 01:43:31.375
Where's Saif?

1139
01:43:35.833 --> 01:43:37.958
Saif. what do we do?

1140
01:43:38.167 --> 01:43:42.667
Najr. now is the time for you to rise.

1141
01:43:43.542 --> 01:43:46.917
Prove to Messiah that you're strong.

1142
01:44:26.125 --> 01:44:27.458
They're breaching from the west.

1143
01:44:27.750 --> 01:44:30.000
Last one. Get them in and stay low!

1144
01:44:30.125 --> 01:44:33.167
-Syam. do you copy?
-West side.

1145
01:44:42.125 --> 01:44:43.083
Hey.

1146
01:45:20.625 --> 01:45:22.083
Zali. are you okay?

1147
01:45:22.875 --> 01:45:24.333
Sir. Zali's down!

1148
01:45:24.750 --> 01:45:26.250
I repeat. Zali is down!

1149
01:45:33.875 --> 01:45:34.875
Damn it!

1150
01:45:38.500 --> 01:45:39.417
Charge!

1151
01:45:49.833 --> 01:45:50.792
Charge!

1152
01:45:53.083 --> 01:45:54.167
Charge!

1153
01:46:15.292 --> 01:46:17.333
-Khai!
-Don't let them get close!

1154
01:46:24.625 --> 01:46:26.833
West block! I need support!

1155
01:46:46.125 --> 01:46:47.708
I'm going inside! You stay here!

1156
01:46:51.542 --> 01:46:52.500
Cover me!

1157
01:46:54.125 --> 01:46:55.042
Now!

1158
01:52:37.083 --> 01:52:38.333
Khai!

1159
01:52:40.458 --> 01:52:41.500
Khai!

1160
01:52:43.875 --> 01:52:45.583
Khai!

1161
01:52:47.542 --> 01:52:49.625
Get up. Khai!

1162
01:52:51.625 --> 01:52:52.625
Khai!

1163
01:53:44.042 --> 01:53:45.083
Help!

1164
01:53:46.125 --> 01:53:47.417
Help!

1165
01:53:48.708 --> 01:53:49.833
Quick!

1166
01:54:07.333 --> 01:54:08.875
What do we do now?

1167
01:54:10.625 --> 01:54:12.958
Get inside. Everyone. inside!

1168
01:54:15.917 --> 01:54:17.042
Squeeze in! Just do it!

1169
01:54:31.208 --> 01:54:32.750
-Go in.
-You?

1170
01:54:32.833 --> 01:54:33.833
Just go!

1171
01:54:47.500 --> 01:54:48.833
Everyone. stay down!

1172
01:56:09.083 --> 01:56:10.958
Don't you see that this is all fated?

1173
01:56:12.792 --> 01:56:16.958
If God is really on your side
and not on mine.

1174
01:56:17.625 --> 01:56:21.333
why are you on your knees again

1175
01:56:21.792 --> 01:56:26.042
while I'm still standing?

1176
01:58:29.875 --> 01:58:31.208
Here we are again.

1177
01:58:32.750 --> 01:58:33.708
Here?

1178
01:58:34.083 --> 01:58:35.042
Here.

1179
01:58:36.083 --> 01:58:37.792
Not six feet under.

1180
01:58:40.375 --> 01:58:43.167
Maybe our work here is not done.

1181
01:58:48.583 --> 01:58:50.792
I keep seeing

1182
01:58:52.167 --> 01:58:53.500
Mat Dan's mom's face.

1183
01:58:56.708 --> 01:58:58.083
Lah's wife's face.

1184
01:58:59.875 --> 01:59:00.833
It's hard.

1185
01:59:08.292 --> 01:59:10.417
There are things we can let go.

1186
01:59:11.083 --> 01:59:12.667
And there are things we must hold on to.

1187
01:59:16.667 --> 01:59:19.333
I'm sure they'd want us
to focus on the job

1188
01:59:20.208 --> 01:59:22.333
and look after those who are still alive.

1189
01:59:32.958 --> 01:59:33.958
Hey.

1190
01:59:35.167 --> 01:59:36.625
Speaking of which.

1191
01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.708
how's that Indonesian cop doing?

1192
01:59:43.500 --> 01:59:44.750
Is she doing okay?

1193
01:59:45.458 --> 01:59:47.833
The last time I saw her
was when we gave our statements.

1194
01:59:49.042 --> 01:59:50.333
She seemed okay.

1195
01:59:50.917 --> 01:59:51.917
That's a relief.

1196
01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:56.083
Hey.

1197
01:59:56.333 --> 01:59:58.208
We wouldn't be here if it wasn't for her.

1198
01:59:59.667 --> 02:00:00.750
Remember that.

1199
02:00:20.208 --> 02:00:21.583
I feel like a goat.

1200
02:00:22.250 --> 02:00:24.292
We eat nothing but leaves.

1201
02:00:27.667 --> 02:00:28.708
Hey.

1202
02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:32.708
For your birthday that day.

1203
02:00:33.292 --> 02:00:34.542
I promised you seafood.

1204
02:00:35.500 --> 02:00:37.917
It's not that I don't want to
or can't afford it.

1205
02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:39.667
but seafood is bad for healing wounds.

1206
02:00:40.458 --> 02:00:41.542
I shouldn't complain.

1207
02:00:42.250 --> 02:00:43.417
Well. I can roll with it.

1208
02:00:43.792 --> 02:00:45.792
As long as the cursed day is over.

1209
02:00:47.500 --> 02:00:49.292
I'm curious about
what will happen next year.

1210
02:00:50.167 --> 02:00:52.042
-Next year? Again?
-Why?

1211
02:00:53.083 --> 02:00:54.083
Are you sick of me?

1212
02:00:54.167 --> 02:00:56.292
No. but how long do we have
to deal with this?

1213
02:00:58.833 --> 02:01:00.833
For as long as we can play the part.

1214
02:01:01.708 --> 02:01:03.375
For as long as we're in demand.

1215
02:01:06.583 --> 02:01:08.000
For as long as they need us.
