1
00:00:02,166 --> 00:00:05,625
101 FM Radio, we play the best music
in Jakarta.

2
00:00:05,708 --> 00:00:11,083
You're still on 101 nonstop music,
with me Ricky Rahim.

3
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:15,333
Streets in Jakarta are ridiculous
right now, so be patient.

4
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:18,166
Try not to use your horn
and make it more stressful.

5
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:22,666
To help you relax, I give you a song
from FSTVLST titled "Ayun Buai Zaman",

6
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,041
only on 101 FM Jak Radio.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,291
Son of a bitch!

8
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:53,708
What is it, Alam?

9
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:54,875
This guy’s pissing me off.

10
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:57,500
Your party is responsible.

11
00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:58,833
Stealing foreign money.

12
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:00,875
Omitting knowledge transfer
from contracts.

13
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:03,916
You and the old regime
are huge exploiters.

14
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:06,083
#LogicRules.

15
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:12,875
Politicians who steal to get ahead
have brains the size of a mini peanut.

16
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,833
That’s hate speech.

17
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:20,250
Be careful. We have laws for that.

18
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:23,708
Hiding behind Internet laws.

19
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:25,541
You spineless douchebag!

20
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,083
Grill the idiot, Alam!

21
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:31,666
-I’m behind you, bro!
-Let’s get moving.

22
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,791
Can you please focus on driving?

23
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:34,875
Yeah, honey. Sorry.

24
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:37,875
Your wife’s in labor,
put your phone down!

25
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:39,750
Okay, honey.

26
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:41,666
You want me to give birth in this car?

27
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,708
Guys like Faisal are everywhere, you know?

28
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:57,000
Always accusing foreigners of stealing.
When, in fact,

29
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:59,416
we’re the corrupt ones.
We don’t use our brains.

30
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,750
It’s important for me to comment.

31
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,500
Alam, there are more important things.

32
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:09,208
What about our budget?

33
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:13,875
You sure we’ll go with this hospital?

34
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:19,208
We could go with the clinic.
It makes more sense financially.

35
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:21,625
Watch out, idiot!

36
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:24,000
Hey, you’re the idiot! Dimwit!

37
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:27,083
Alam, cut it out!

38
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:28,958
He called me an idiot!

39
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:29,875
And he kicked our car.

40
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:31,500
Just drive, will you?

41
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:35,083
Don’t mind the motorbikes.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,708
Hon, I may be an idealistic blogger
running an indie publishing house,

43
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:46,958
but I’m a hot daddy-to-be
who knows his priorities.

44
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,416
Jokes? Really?

45
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,666
Take a chill pill.

46
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,750
Alam, please!

47
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,291
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

48
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,041
Please, just drive.

49
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:01,833
Drive, or I will give birth
in this goddamn car!

50
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,291
I promise.

51
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:33,458
Okay.

52
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:36,583
Everything will be just fine, okay?

53
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:37,666
Okay.

54
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:50,291
Doctor Rivat, to the ER please.

55
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,250
Doctor Rivat, to the ER.

56
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:57,791
-Hon…
-Yeah?

57
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:00,583
Can you adjust the cushion?
I need to lay back.

58
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:05,916
Like this? Careful. All good and comfy?

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,916
Yeah.

60
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,208
Don’t diss other people
about responsibility,

61
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:24,625
when you’re stealing people’s jobs
with your pseudo-publishing.

62
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:29,375
Non-margin, bro?
I thought you were progressive. Thief!

63
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:30,750
Shit.

64
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:34,916
Why is your T-shirt inside out?

65
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:41,916
You were having a contraction,
I didn’t care what I’d look like.

66
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,958
Besides, the Chinese say it's good luck.

67
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,375
Amen to that.

68
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,583
Zee Zag must be bummed.

69
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,083
Their ideas are spread hypocritically.

70
00:04:55,541 --> 00:05:00,541
While my publishing house, Kalam Vortex,
is trying to acquire the legal rights.

71
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,250
In the name of freedom of information,

72
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,625
non-margin publishers are here.

73
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:08,708
Don’t compare us with the tiny logics
of information corporations.

74
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,625
Hon, come on.

75
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,625
You’re also playing with your phone.

76
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:21,125
I’m not playing, I’m working!

77
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:23,083
Not engaging in some Twitter war!

78
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:27,208
My work pays for this. Come on.

79
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,375
Number 314, proceed to counter.

80
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,583
A thief is a thief.

81
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,541
-No need to use fancy lingo
-Alam,

82
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,916
-that's our number.
-like corrupt politicians.

83
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,416
Alam, focus!

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,083
Okay.

85
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,500
For God’s sake.

86
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:52,208
No use talking about responsibility
with a guy who knocked up his girlfriend

87
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:55,375
so he could marry her.
#NotGettingIt

88
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:59,250
Guess @amrinpasaribu will never get it.

89
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,041
We have to fight
for the in-laws’ blessings!

90
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:02,791
Hi, there.

91
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,666
-Yes.
-Yes.

92
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:07,916
-VIP Normal Birth Package, please.
-All right.

93
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
This is the brochure. And this is my ID.

94
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:11,166
-Fill this out, please.
-Yes.

95
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,500
Smile, please?

96
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:13,541
Smile.

97
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:18,875
Okay, thank you.

98
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:23,166
I can take my wife to have our baby
in a proper hospital.

99
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:28,791
Not like you. With a midwife.
#KeepCalm #BeResponsible

100
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,791
Sari, what are you doing here?

101
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:42,458
Hunting for Pokémon.
I’m here for you, silly!

102
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,541
-So nice of you.
-Are you here alone?

103
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:48,041
No, Alam’s over there.
He’s booking our room.

104
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:59,583
Oh, so this @alamerdeka guy
is a pot calling the kettle black.

105
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,375
-Sir.
-Hold on.

106
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,958
Empty vessels make the most noise.

107
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,750
Sir?

108
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,958
Blame the one banging on
the vessels, dude!

109
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:13,750
Sir, I’ve counted twice.
It’s not enough money.

110
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,583
What do you mean not enough?

111
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,291
-Not enough.
-It’s 500 bucks, right?

112
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:22,916
The hospital’s anniversary discount?

113
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,958
Here let me count it for you.

114
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:29,458
The promotion period has ended.

115
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:33,000
Since when?
The discount is for the whole month.

116
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,083
Since today.

117
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:35,541
It’s the first day of the next month.

118
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:38,166
But today is the 30th, lady.

119
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:39,541
Here, I’ll count…

120
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:43,083
Sir, it’s for February.

121
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:47,166
Yes, it’s a leap year,
but the month still ends on the 29th.

122
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,375
The VIP price

123
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:04,625
is now back to $1,500.

124
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:16,500
Maybe you’d like to discuss
with your wife…

125
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,166
She doesn’t know about this!

126
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,833
I’m dead.

127
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,000
Hon, come here.

128
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:34,416
Look, Sari has brought us everything.

129
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,083
Blankets,

130
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:37,750
pads.

131
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:41,333
You don’t have to go back to the store.
Say thank you.

132
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,166
I’m going for my Friday prayer.

133
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,250
But that’s so not you.

134
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,750
People can change, right?

135
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,791
I’m about to be a dad.

136
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,291
Thanks.

137
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:06,458
I get it. He’s turning into a new man.

138
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,458
Let’s hope it lasts.

139
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:11,750
Don’t be a jerk!

140
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:17,583
Where am I going to get the money?

141
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,208
This is nuts.

142
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:32,916
Who parked here? Who parked here?

143
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,208
Oh, I see.

144
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,166
Government official’s car
can park anywhere.

145
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:40,250
My wife’s pregnant,
and we got a shitty parking spot.

146
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:57,166
@alamerdeka I demand that you
apologize publicly,

147
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,083
and take all your false accusations back.

148
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:00,583
What a douchebag!

149
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,791
I have to get back to the office.

150
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:04,666
Right now?

151
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:08,458
Yup. They’ve been texting me,
I might come back later today.

152
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,166
-Bye.
-Thanks, Sari.

153
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:12,208
Keep me updated.

154
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:13,416
I will.

155
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,625
You wait here, okay?

156
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:15,791
Hold on.

157
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,083
-You’re good?
-Don’t be too long.

158
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:19,250
-I won’t.
-Your bag?

159
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:32,750
Don’t hide, @alamerdeka.
Or my lawsuit will find you.

160
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:36,291
I’m not hiding, you asshole!

161
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:37,875
Allah, have mercy.

162
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:41,041
I meant, a hole.
Someone’s hiding in a hole.

163
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:43,958
Contractions?

164
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:47,000
I had one earlier, but not now.

165
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,666
Didn’t you have sex
with your husband this morning?

166
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,041
Huh?

167
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:55,541
No.

168
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:59,791
It’s the best natural induction, you know?

169
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,791
And it feels good, too.

170
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,291
You don’t believe me?

171
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,833
-Hello, Alam.
-Mr. Fuad?

172
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,583
-Yes, Sir.
-How's the Zee Zag book?

173
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:21,833
-What took you so long?
-Be patient.

174
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:22,916
-I can't.
-We don’t have to rush.

175
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,791
-Have you heard of slow living?
-How about I’ll slowly kill you?

176
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,625
-Don’t be like that.
-What?

177
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,208
Look, I’m in the middle
of my Friday prayer.

178
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:31,666
I’m trying to get in the front row.

179
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,208
-More reward from God, they say.
-Alright.

180
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,083
-Bye now.
-Bye.

181
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:37,500
Cover up, boy!

182
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:43,833
You’re in a mosque, not the beach.

183
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,166
-Thank you.
-Yes.

184
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:54,541
I’m sad. People are talking about
our personal life.

185
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:58,083
Come on, Alam. Let that book go to Amrin.

186
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:04,041
Peace be upon you.

187
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:08,125
Peace be upon you.

188
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,750
All praise belongs to Allah.

189
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:18,208
Peaceful mind, peaceful heart.
#SpiritualFriday

190
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,541
With my firstborn,

191
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,208
it took me 20 hours.

192
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:26,416
20 hours?

193
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,708
20 hours of labor!

194
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,458
Imagine that.

195
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,875
But I’m wiser now.
This morning we did our hanky panky.

196
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,333
Our VIP room is ready.

197
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:38,333
It's him!

198
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:43,583
It’s so hard to get.
This hospital is like…

199
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,625
-Like what?
-A hotel in Bali during high season.

200
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:46,958
-Oh, like when we were there?
-Yes.

201
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:47,875
Our honeymoon?

202
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:51,166
You remember?
You want another honeymoon?

203
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,541
I do! I loved our suite.

204
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:57,791
MOM

205
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:03,458
Yes, Mom. No, not that one.

206
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,291
The one in Semanggi.

207
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:07,291
Yes.

208
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:09,583
You’re with Dad, right?

209
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,458
Usep and Tantri, too?

210
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:17,541
Don’t bring a crowd, please. Mom?

211
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,541
It’s all yours.

212
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:44,458
Peace be upon you.

213
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:49,375
Peace be upon you.

214
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:52,833
-May Allah the Almighty…
-Isn’t he running for governor?

215
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,625
…give us guidance,

216
00:13:55,208 --> 00:14:00,750
so we can vote for the ideal leader.

217
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,750
Look at the current situation.

218
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,833
Flooding everywhere,

219
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:09,875
poor people are being evicted
from their own homes.

220
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:10,875
I know where he’s going with this.

221
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:15,041
Everyone is angry.
Demonstrations every day. Why?

222
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,875
Because they’re disappointed!

223
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:26,000
I will fix it all!

224
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,541
So, with all conviction,

225
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:32,666
I am running for governor…

226
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,666
Interruption!

227
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,291
This is a place of prayer.
Not for political campaigns.

228
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,083
-What the hell is this?
-Can he be any more vulgar?

229
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,375
You might as well
try selling underwear on that podium.

230
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:46,041
-This is a place of prayer!
-Because it is a place of prayer,

231
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:49,375
-it deserves more respect.
-Come on!

232
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:52,875
Hey, let go of me, dude!

233
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:07,333
There’s a more dignified way to protest,
you know.

234
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,541
Just walk out, like me. Don’t be childish.

235
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:12,958
Why are you giving me a sermon?
Why do you care?

236
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:15,291
Of course, I care.

237
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,791
People like you give Islam a bad name.

238
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:23,166
Be critical logically. Not emotionally.

239
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,541
Don’t use your brain the wrong way,
like you wear your shirt.

240
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,958
Where are you?
I’m already on dilation two.

241
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,208
ACCOUNT BALANCE: $ 1.3

242
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:45,750
I’ll be waiting, okay?
Don’t meet me at the hospital.

243
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,750
If my wife finds out, I’m dead.

244
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,625
My family is on their way, too.

245
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:56,083
I’ll let you know.
Somewhere near the hospital.

246
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:58,708
-See you.
-Just a little bit more.

247
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:03,416
Okay, you’re good.

248
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,833
Good day, Madam, can I help you?

249
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:15,291
The 20th floor? That way.
One floor up. Thank you.

250
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,375
-Excuse me.
-Yeah?

251
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:19,916
Do you know any cheap places to eat?

252
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,250
Cheaper than the cafeteria?

253
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,208
There’s a place over there.

254
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:26,791
-Near the construction site.
-Yes.

255
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:30,541
A canteen. The food there is cheap.

256
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:33,416
-Like a food stall?
-That’s right. Over there.

257
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:35,500
-Thank you.
-You’re welcome.

258
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:47,000
-Hello.
-Alam, where are you?

259
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,958
-I just finished Friday prayer.
-It's stuck.

260
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:52,833
I spent a little extra time at the mosque,
praying for our baby.

261
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:56,291
Where are you now? What's that noise?

262
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:58,833
-Alam?
-Why did you turn it off, man?

263
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,333
The music was good.

264
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:01,416
I’m moving the car now,

265
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,250
so you don’t have to walk far
when you get out of the hospital.

266
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,208
That's not important, Alam.

267
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,000
Be patient, I’ll be right there.

268
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:12,541
But that's not important!
I'm already in the ER.

269
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:15,916
-Yes. I have to go.
-Hurry up!

270
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,458
Sorry about that.

271
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,125
Can I have a coffee? Sorry.

272
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:38,541
Alam, you’re lucky I was just about
to go out when you called.

273
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:40,875
I appreciate it.

274
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:02,916
So how much do I get for this?

275
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,625
As we said on the phone. Here.

276
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,833
I could give you more

277
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:18,833
for your car and laptop. But you said no.

278
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,458
How on earth am I going to pay for that?

279
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,583
I haven’t paid you
my last debt for my wedding.

280
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:32,750
Debts and logic don’t mix, dude.
Borrow what you need.

281
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,500
Sure, you’re getting interest out of it.

282
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:37,458
I’m killing myself paying for it.

283
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:38,875
What can I say?

284
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,416
I wouldn’t be doing this
if it weren’t an emergency.

285
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:45,458
600 bucks enough for your kid?

286
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:48,708
Should be enough.

287
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,208
I have to go.

288
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,625
Where are you going? Let’s hang out first.

289
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:56,000
My wife’s looking for me.

290
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,125
Can you get this coffee?

291
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,291
Man, he’s paying, okay?

292
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:05,041
If you need more, call me!

293
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,833
Sir, Ma’am, here’s your room.

294
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,625
Yes, thank you, Nurse.

295
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,083
Excuse me.

296
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,125
Hold on.

297
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,333
Alam, aren’t we getting the VIP room?

298
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:34,791
We’ll be here temporarily.
The VIP rooms are all occupied.

299
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,583
But my 500 bucks
are for the VIP room, right?

300
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:41,125
Yes, that’s right. But the rooms are full,

301
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:44,041
so we’ll be here for a while, honey.

302
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,875
Doesn’t matter to me, really.

303
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:50,333
Easy, Ma’am.

304
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,041
Easy.

305
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,375
Easy.

306
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,500
Trust me, okay.

307
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,208
We’re not having money problems, are we?

308
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:05,041
No problems!

309
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:06,458
Alright?

310
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,041
Let me take care of some paperwork. Okay?

311
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:17,916
I’ll be right back.

312
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,291
Let’s change your clothes, shall we?

313
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,041
Lady?

314
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,958
Hey, lady.
I want to ask you about the discount.

315
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,625
Your brochure is misleading.

316
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:43,041
You should’ve put the exact date,
so it’s clear.

317
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:46,791
I’m sure I’m not the only one
who's fallen for it.

318
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,750
I should get the VIP room,
but now I’m downgraded to second class.

319
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:49,666
What do you have to say?

320
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:54,416
I’m sorry, Sir. It is clearly stated.
You should’ve read more carefully.

321
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,125
What do you mean? I did.

322
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,208
I read the form.

323
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,500
But look at this. Such tiny letters.

324
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,416
Now tell me, can you read this?

325
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:07,166
Yes, I can.

326
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,375
Well, you got healthy eyes.
What about those with eye problems?

327
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:14,666
If you really want to trick people,
use 3D glasses...

328
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:16,375
Sir, it hasn’t been an hour,

329
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,666
and you already asked
for an installment policy.

330
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,125
And I granted your request.

331
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:25,250
That sounds nice. I would’ve requested
an installment plan if I'd known.

332
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,166
It’s their responsibility.
The promo was unclear.

333
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:34,166
Second class is the same, I’m telling you.

334
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:37,000
Besides, the VIP rooms are all full.

335
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:47,000
Can I get the installment plan too?

336
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:51,083
I’m sorry, not possible.

337
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:03,541
Be careful, lady.
And God, you’re pregnant!

338
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:05,958
You’re putting yourself in danger.

339
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,291
-Your baby is your responsibility.
-Yes, Sir.

340
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:10,625
I know, I’m sorry.

341
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,500
-Just be careful.
-Thank you, Sir.

342
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,416
Yeah.

343
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:28,291
Can I have a glass? Just the glass.

344
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:33,458
The water’s free, right?

345
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:47,166
Hello, how about that book bidding?

346
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:51,458
I thought you'd called
to tell me you’re a father now.

347
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,250
Forget about the bidding.

348
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,375
What do you mean? I don’t get it.

349
00:22:57,541 --> 00:23:00,000
-Mr. Ingkus has been transferred.
-But the tender is clear.

350
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:04,125
That is corruption.
The bosses are afraid of KPK.

351
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:06,750
The tender is still unclear.

352
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:11,375
Then what about Nandi?
We borrowed money from him for this bid.

353
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:14,208
Nandi is different from Ivan.

354
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:18,041
He’d literally rip off my balls. Shit!

355
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:20,666
I don’t know, man. I’m way over my head.

356
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:23,708
Don't be...

357
00:23:23,791 --> 00:23:25,083
Crazy jerk!

358
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,125
How am I supposed to pay for the hospital?

359
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:35,666
Sorry. Personal problems.

360
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:13,875
What kind of hospital is this?
Where are the doctors and nurses?

361
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:18,750
-Usep! Tantri! Come here.
-Yes, Mom.

362
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:21,583
Are you sure we’re in the right hospital?

363
00:24:21,666 --> 00:24:22,500
We are, Madam.

364
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:25,666
Where are the…?
Oh, hello, Emi. How are you?

365
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:28,208
-Hey, you’re here, too.
-How are you?

366
00:24:28,291 --> 00:24:30,625
-Of course, why wouldn’t I be?
-How are you?

367
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:33,708
-You look so fresh. Look at those cheeks.
-You are so beautiful.

368
00:24:33,791 --> 00:24:36,208
-So do you. You’re gorgeous.
-Dear, come here.

369
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:38,000
Dear. This is the boy’s mother.

370
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:41,000
-How are you? Are you well?
-He's good.

371
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:44,458
Such a handsome man.

372
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:48,666
-You’re so fresh. What’s your secret?
-Thank you.

373
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:52,416
-Is it the skincare from that website?
-Oh no, no.

374
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:56,333
I can’t get enough of online shopping
myself. Look at all of this.

375
00:24:56,416 --> 00:24:58,208
-That’s so beautiful. The colors and all.
-I bought it online.

376
00:24:58,291 --> 00:25:02,458
This old thing? I sewed this myself.
When I was pregnant with Alam.

377
00:25:02,541 --> 00:25:05,583
-Oh my, that is old. Usep!
-Yes.

378
00:25:05,666 --> 00:25:09,708
-Go find out where Mia’s room is.
-Where is Mia's room?

379
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:10,666
Bring clothes for Alam.

380
00:25:11,958 --> 00:25:16,500
Dear, come here.

381
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:19,666
-I have to pee.
-Just wait, dear.

382
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,166
So what room is she in?

383
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,833
I can't stand it.

384
00:25:24,916 --> 00:25:27,625
So all of your family is here?

385
00:25:27,708 --> 00:25:31,333
No, they’re just relatives… Dear!

386
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:37,208
They happen to live nearby.
So they can come here directly.

387
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:39,916
And yours?

388
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,833
Such a tiny family. Just these two?

389
00:25:44,916 --> 00:25:50,916
These are Alam’s neighbors and friends.
They’re here to help out.

390
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,708
-Oh, neighbors.
-Sir.

391
00:25:52,791 --> 00:25:57,583
-Usep! So where’s the room?
-Bring clothes for Alam.

392
00:26:01,458 --> 00:26:02,458
Huh?

393
00:26:06,625 --> 00:26:07,583
Really?

394
00:26:09,541 --> 00:26:11,666
Why not VIP?

395
00:26:18,708 --> 00:26:19,708
Hello, little one.

396
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,458
-Hi.
-Honey.

397
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:28,166
All under control?

398
00:26:29,416 --> 00:26:32,666
Yeah. All good.

399
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,833
Have you heard from the doctor?

400
00:26:37,583 --> 00:26:40,083
Doctor Titi will be here
for the ultrasound.

401
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:45,833
Alam,

402
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:51,833
whatever happens, I want to have…

403
00:26:51,916 --> 00:26:56,083
A normal birth.
Yes, I guarantee you that will happen.

404
00:26:56,166 --> 00:26:57,208
-Yes.
-Yes.

405
00:26:58,541 --> 00:27:00,916
Just like your mother. Six kids.

406
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:05,416
One as big as you.
All alone. All normal births.

407
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,083
I have to be that strong.

408
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:13,666
I have to do whatever it takes
for this baby. We have to fight for it.

409
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:23,041
Hey, don’t be vulgar.
What’s wrong with you?

410
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:26,916
You want the baby to have extra ears?

411
00:27:29,041 --> 00:27:31,166
-Who are you coming with?
-With them.

412
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,458
Where’s your husband?

413
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,875
There he is.

414
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:43,625
Usep, Tantri, not so loud.
There’s another patient.

415
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,500
What’s going on?

416
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:51,166
Dad!

417
00:27:51,416 --> 00:27:53,541
There you are!

418
00:27:55,291 --> 00:27:57,708
-You’re stepping on my toes!
-Why are you standing there?

419
00:27:57,791 --> 00:28:00,708
Relax. Sorry, there’s another patient.

420
00:28:00,791 --> 00:28:01,875
-What?
-Sorry, another patient.

421
00:28:01,958 --> 00:28:06,583
Stop saying sorry. Why aren’t you in VIP?

422
00:28:06,666 --> 00:28:08,458
This room’s so tiny.

423
00:28:08,541 --> 00:28:11,500
You need a proper room. This won’t do!

424
00:28:11,583 --> 00:28:12,833
-You don’t have money?
-It’s not that.

425
00:28:12,916 --> 00:28:15,375
-It's not that.
-You can always ask me and your dad.

426
00:28:15,458 --> 00:28:16,458
-Mom!
-Mom,

427
00:28:16,541 --> 00:28:18,791
Mom, it’s not that.

428
00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:22,541
All the VIP rooms are full.
So we’re here temporarily.

429
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,583
What’s the problem?

430
00:28:24,666 --> 00:28:29,041
-This is our first grandchild.
-God, this boy!

431
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:30,916
Of course I want the best for her.

432
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,541
And Doctor Titi is handling Mia.
The best doctor.

433
00:28:35,625 --> 00:28:37,083
Promises, promises!

434
00:28:37,166 --> 00:28:40,958
-Excuse me.
-Oh hi, doctor.

435
00:28:41,041 --> 00:28:42,250
Mrs. Mia?

436
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,041
Doctor Titi is a man?

437
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:45,416
No, no, no.
Where’s Doctor Titi?

438
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:49,833
Doctor Titi is not available.
I’m the obstetrician on duty.

439
00:28:49,916 --> 00:28:52,083
So young. Is he even capable?

440
00:28:52,166 --> 00:28:54,583
Are you an intern?
A recent graduate?

441
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:59,500
I’m here for the ultrasound.
Could some of you wait outside, please?

442
00:28:59,583 --> 00:29:00,666
I hope you don’t mind
waiting outside.

443
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:03,750
Yes, Nurse, yes.

444
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:06,708
-Sir? Excuse me.
-Oh, please, Doctor.

445
00:29:06,791 --> 00:29:08,833
-Let’s draw the blinds.
-Yeah.

446
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,250
Uhm...

447
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:15,208
-Is it okay if I stay?
-Yes, Sir.

448
00:29:30,291 --> 00:29:31,375
How is it, Doctor?

449
00:29:35,833 --> 00:29:37,458
Yes, I’m checking.

450
00:29:39,166 --> 00:29:41,666
Nurse, why do you keep staring
at my husband?

451
00:29:42,916 --> 00:29:45,541
You’re Alam Merdeka, right? Right?

452
00:29:46,333 --> 00:29:49,000
I’m one of your followers.

453
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:52,750
Follow me back, please!

454
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,916
What follower?

455
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,625
Twitter. He’s got tens of thousands.

456
00:29:57,708 --> 00:29:58,541
48,000.

457
00:29:58,625 --> 00:29:59,458
Did you go to all your check-ups?

458
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,000
When was the last time?

459
00:30:03,291 --> 00:30:04,875
Uhm, when was it…

460
00:30:05,541 --> 00:30:07,500
-You don’t know? When?
-Quite a while ago.

461
00:30:08,041 --> 00:30:09,291
It’s a breech birth.

462
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:11,583
-Oh dear God!
-Oh dear God!

463
00:30:11,666 --> 00:30:13,083
The baby is big, too.

464
00:30:13,166 --> 00:30:16,625
Mia, you should’ve gone to
your check-ups!

465
00:30:16,708 --> 00:30:21,125
That’s it. We’re moving to VIP.
And having a C-section!

466
00:30:21,208 --> 00:30:25,625
-Dad!
-Dad!

467
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:36,416
I’ve never meddled in your business,

468
00:30:37,625 --> 00:30:40,208
because I trusted and respected you.

469
00:30:41,708 --> 00:30:44,291
But can you not embarrass me?

470
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:48,250
Hey, Alam! Answer me!

471
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:51,791
Thank you, Doctor.

472
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,333
Everything okay?

473
00:30:53,416 --> 00:30:54,416
Okay, Doctor.

474
00:30:57,291 --> 00:30:59,208
-Thank you, Nurse.
-Yes, Ma’am.

475
00:31:03,541 --> 00:31:07,625
-Wake up, Uncle.
-Give him some room.

476
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,083
Hold him.

477
00:31:09,166 --> 00:31:13,541
-Easy, Uncle. Say a little prayer. Oh God.
-Give him some water.

478
00:31:13,625 --> 00:31:15,416
-My cane! My cane!
-The cane.

479
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:42,500
Nurse, where is Doctor Titi?

480
00:31:43,333 --> 00:31:48,166
She’s at a medical entrepreneurship
symposium

481
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:51,500
in London.

482
00:31:53,666 --> 00:31:56,250
Don’t be so surprised, Sir.

483
00:31:56,708 --> 00:32:01,416
It’s been four months
since your last check-up.

484
00:32:01,833 --> 00:32:05,708
So it’s not our fault
if your schedule is messed up.

485
00:32:08,375 --> 00:32:13,625
Absurd! Why is a symposium more important
than my wife giving birth?

486
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:15,625
How could she?

487
00:32:16,416 --> 00:32:18,250
How is it just your business?

488
00:32:18,708 --> 00:32:22,000
Your baby is getting as big as I am!

489
00:32:22,291 --> 00:32:25,666
Look at your belly.
You just found out now?

490
00:32:25,916 --> 00:32:28,291
I still want a normal birth!

491
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:31,000
Oh dear God, a normal birth.

492
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:32,958
Four kilos. You know how big that is?

493
00:32:33,333 --> 00:32:35,333
It’s the size of a gallon of water!

494
00:32:35,583 --> 00:32:38,166
Twice my thigh. As big as her thigh!

495
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,541
And a breech birth!

496
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:46,583
How is it going to come out? How?

497
00:32:47,125 --> 00:32:49,500
Tantri, pack up.

498
00:32:49,583 --> 00:32:50,750
-Hey, Tantri.
-Yes?

499
00:32:50,833 --> 00:32:52,791
Don’t touch my things. Back off!

500
00:32:53,083 --> 00:32:56,000
-You work for me, right? I said pack up!
-No!

501
00:32:56,083 --> 00:33:00,250
-Mom, enough. Tantri, back off!
-Good riddance, Mia!

502
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:03,541
So next time, with your second child,

503
00:33:03,833 --> 00:33:06,541
regular check-ups, okay?

504
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,416
Fine, you want war?

505
00:33:16,208 --> 00:33:20,791
I’m not afraid. Remember, Nurse,
this is the era of social media

506
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,708
I have 48,000 Twitter followers.

507
00:33:23,791 --> 00:33:28,166
I could tell the whole world this hospital
is crappy to its patients.

508
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:30,208
They’re mistreated. I’m tweeting it.

509
00:33:33,375 --> 00:33:35,250
Very well.

510
00:33:35,333 --> 00:33:39,583
If you want to deal with our lawyers.

511
00:33:43,666 --> 00:33:44,833
Shit!

512
00:33:46,916 --> 00:33:52,000
Just my two cents.
We have to use our social media wisely.

513
00:33:54,875 --> 00:33:57,000
-Hey, Nurse! Come here.
-Yes.

514
00:33:58,833 --> 00:34:01,250
-Is Doctor Titi really away?
-Yes, Sir.

515
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,916
-Is there another doctor?
-There is.

516
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,375
I want to speak to your head nurse,
or somebody.

517
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:11,458
Wait a moment, Sir.

518
00:34:12,875 --> 00:34:14,416
Your dad?

519
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:19,125
Your dad never gave birth.
He never gave birth!

520
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:20,916
Dad, please talk to Mom.

521
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,375
Tantri, pack up her stuff.
What’s wrong with you?

522
00:34:23,958 --> 00:34:28,041
-How?
-Sorry, Madam. All VIPs are full.

523
00:34:28,916 --> 00:34:31,708
But relax, we’re on the baiting list.

524
00:34:32,875 --> 00:34:35,166
-Yes, that’s what I meant.
-We’re next in line, right?

525
00:34:35,416 --> 00:34:37,458
-Ten more patients.
-For God’s sake, ten?

526
00:34:37,541 --> 00:34:40,083
When will we get in? Next year?

527
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:44,291
-Mom, chill!
-Is the AC off? So warm in here.

528
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:45,750
Mom, please calm down.

529
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,625
-Bring an AC from home!
-Dad.

530
00:34:48,791 --> 00:34:49,875
Can I help you, Sir?

531
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:51,291
Well...

532
00:34:51,625 --> 00:34:53,666
If Doctor Titi’s not available,
no problem.

533
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:55,291
But please get someone with her caliber.

534
00:34:55,375 --> 00:34:58,708
Not a snooty ob-gyn boy.
This is my firstborn!

535
00:34:58,791 --> 00:35:02,333
Sir, all our doctors
have the same qualifications.

536
00:35:02,416 --> 00:35:05,500
You’re just saying that!

537
00:35:05,583 --> 00:35:07,750
I need action! No one’s helping me out.

538
00:35:07,833 --> 00:35:10,916
It’s because I’m not a VIP patient, right?
This is discrimination!

539
00:35:11,208 --> 00:35:13,250
If you don’t calm down,
I’m calling security.

540
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:17,416
This is a hospital, not a hotel.

541
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:23,375
All patients get the same treatment.
So, please, you’re not being rational.

542
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:26,791
I want the best for my wife.
Will you help me out?

543
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,666
I’m tired here. Those are my in-laws.
What am I supposed to tell them?

544
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:39,041
And she’s so loud,
you can hear her from a mile away…

545
00:35:39,125 --> 00:35:43,375
Okay, do you want me
to speak to your in-laws?

546
00:35:43,458 --> 00:35:48,333
Don’t do that. You might as well kill me.
Just euthanize me now!

547
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:13,041
Mia, please have a C-section.
Don't mind about the money.

548
00:36:13,791 --> 00:36:15,833
Your dad and I can help you.

549
00:36:16,958 --> 00:36:20,791
Mom, give it up. I told you, no C-section.

550
00:36:21,416 --> 00:36:23,583
The doctor said there’s nothing wrong
with me.

551
00:36:23,666 --> 00:36:25,166
Is that so?

552
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:28,791
Lucky you’re not diabetic.

553
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:32,875
I’m about to have a heart attack here.
Right, Emi?

554
00:36:35,291 --> 00:36:38,166
Don’t hurt your parents’ feelings.

555
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:41,625
Don’t be stubborn like your dad.

556
00:36:41,708 --> 00:36:46,125
Hey, dear! Say something, dear!

557
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:50,583
Leave Dad alone.
You said it yourself, he never gave birth.

558
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,500
You have to listen to Alam, too.

559
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,791
The boy can’t even
wear his shirt properly.

560
00:36:54,875 --> 00:36:55,791
Alam!

561
00:36:56,375 --> 00:36:58,208
Yes, the boy. That’s what I said.

562
00:36:58,291 --> 00:37:01,625
Alam! His name’s Alam,
and he’s my husband.

563
00:37:01,916 --> 00:37:03,500
Yes, your husband, the boy.

564
00:37:03,583 --> 00:37:04,625
Alam!

565
00:37:04,708 --> 00:37:07,416
Yes, the boy’s your husband.
Your dad’s my husband.

566
00:37:08,041 --> 00:37:10,166
Dad is Mom's husband.

567
00:37:25,833 --> 00:37:26,916
Oh, hey, Mr. Alam.

568
00:37:36,875 --> 00:37:37,958
-Doctor…
-Don’t worry about it.

569
00:37:38,958 --> 00:37:40,500
We’re in the same boat today.

570
00:37:42,625 --> 00:37:44,625
People see us as incapable.

571
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:52,666
I’ve been an ob-gyn for seven years.
But, I still have no kids of my own.

572
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:56,250
I’m still grateful, though.
Trying to live as a good person.

573
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,791
My wife once said to me,

574
00:37:58,875 --> 00:38:01,791
“Every child comes from God.

575
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:07,583
So He will always pick the right person
to help with the process.”

576
00:38:09,458 --> 00:38:14,541
Well, I guess that’s my destiny.

577
00:38:19,791 --> 00:38:23,500
Just take it easy, Mr. Alam.
I’ll see you in delivery.

578
00:38:24,041 --> 00:38:24,958
Yes, doctor.

579
00:38:50,875 --> 00:38:52,000
No one’s here?

580
00:38:58,791 --> 00:39:02,291
Another empty room? So strange.

581
00:39:08,375 --> 00:39:10,000
Ah, here’s a bigger room.

582
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:21,208
-Hey. You’re the guy from before.
-Hi again, lady from before. Sorry,

583
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:22,500
I thought this room was empty.

584
00:39:24,625 --> 00:39:27,208
-Can I help you, Mr. Alam?
-You startled me!

585
00:39:27,291 --> 00:39:32,541
-Looking for a tweet material?
-No. Does she have this room to herself?

586
00:39:33,708 --> 00:39:36,958
Yes, she does.
This part of the building is still empty.

587
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,291
You’re lucky, you know.

588
00:39:40,375 --> 00:39:45,541
Mrs. Dian over there,
her husband is working in Dubai.

589
00:39:45,625 --> 00:39:47,750
He left her.

590
00:39:47,833 --> 00:39:51,875
She’s going through this alone.
Her family lives out of town.

591
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:54,250
-Wait a minute.
-Yes?

592
00:39:54,958 --> 00:39:56,458
So the whole floor is empty?

593
00:39:56,833 --> 00:40:01,166
Yes, the soft opening
was just three days ago.

594
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:06,916
Most patients prefer the other wing.
So, only a few rooms are occupied.

595
00:40:08,041 --> 00:40:10,666
-Where’s marketing?
-5th floor.

596
00:40:11,875 --> 00:40:16,375
-Now you startled me!
-Sorry. Thank you, Nurse!

597
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:17,375
No problem!

598
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:22,166
Everybody, we’re moving to a new room.

599
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:25,958
-Now?
-Yes, to a bigger room.

600
00:40:26,041 --> 00:40:29,583
-VIP!
-Usep, Tantri.

601
00:41:18,416 --> 00:41:22,875
Hm, this is the room? It’s bigger, yes.

602
00:41:22,958 --> 00:41:27,708
-But, well, it’s still not VIP, is it?
-Mom.

603
00:41:28,333 --> 00:41:30,416
Smells like paint in here.
Is this fresh paint?

604
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,250
Mom, chill, go sit down.

605
00:41:32,333 --> 00:41:35,208
The smell can’t be good for you, Mia.
Dear, close your nose.

606
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,208
-Mom, it's fine.
-The room is huge.

607
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:44,791
Good job, hon.

608
00:41:47,916 --> 00:41:48,916
Let’s take a selfie.

609
00:41:54,208 --> 00:41:56,375
-How lame.
-Calm, Sir.

610
00:41:56,708 --> 00:41:58,125
Here’s the caption. See?

611
00:42:00,416 --> 00:42:01,875
How did we get this room?

612
00:42:02,583 --> 00:42:03,458
This.

613
00:42:04,958 --> 00:42:06,666
-So, here’s the deal, Sir.
-Yes?

614
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:08,000
According to my notes,

615
00:42:08,916 --> 00:42:12,083
social media influencers

616
00:42:12,166 --> 00:42:15,083
with around 50,000 followers
get $30 per tweet.

617
00:42:15,916 --> 00:42:19,166
Okay. I may only have 48,000 followers,

618
00:42:19,666 --> 00:42:21,500
but they are very active.

619
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:23,541
They’re all organic, no robots.

620
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:28,041
So every time I tweet,
they will respond and retweet.

621
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:28,958
Alright.

622
00:42:29,041 --> 00:42:31,208
I’ll give you a special package.

623
00:42:32,958 --> 00:42:36,291
How about 20 tweets? Deal?

624
00:42:36,375 --> 00:42:39,083
-I don’t know.
-The 33rd floor is still empty.

625
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,666
A little promotion won’t hurt, right?

626
00:42:41,333 --> 00:42:45,041
I guess so. Let me speak to my manager.
Can you wait here?

627
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:47,083
-Yes, I’ll wait here for the good news.
-Okay.

628
00:42:47,541 --> 00:42:49,625
So, no more nagging
when I’m playing with my phone!

629
00:42:52,708 --> 00:42:55,375
Now that’s smart. That’s my Alam!

630
00:42:55,458 --> 00:42:57,083
This is so you.

631
00:43:02,791 --> 00:43:03,916
-Alam.
-What?

632
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,333
Come here. Go make up with Dad.

633
00:43:07,583 --> 00:43:10,083
-I will.
-Now.

634
00:43:10,166 --> 00:43:12,083
-Later.
-Now. There’s no better time.

635
00:43:12,166 --> 00:43:13,916
-One thing at a time, okay?
-Come on, Alam.

636
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,625
First things first. You go in labor, then…

637
00:43:16,708 --> 00:43:20,375
Listen.
My relatives say Dad never laughs anymore.

638
00:43:20,458 --> 00:43:21,500
But that’s because of the stroke.

639
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:25,208
Well, who gave him the stroke?
Because he found out I was knocked up.

640
00:43:26,083 --> 00:43:27,208
Come on. Please.

641
00:43:27,291 --> 00:43:28,791
-I will. Later, okay?
-I would be even more grateful to you.

642
00:43:28,875 --> 00:43:30,125
-Please.
-Yes.

643
00:43:30,583 --> 00:43:34,000
Gosh, it hurts. Rub my tummy.

644
00:43:35,041 --> 00:43:36,791
-What is it?
-Nurse?

645
00:43:36,875 --> 00:43:38,250
-Hey, you!
-Yes, Sir?

646
00:43:38,333 --> 00:43:41,708
-Take care of my daughter!
-We'll be there ASAP.

647
00:43:42,625 --> 00:43:44,250
Rub my tummy, damn it!

648
00:43:44,958 --> 00:43:46,333
What took you so long?

649
00:43:46,416 --> 00:43:48,333
Yes, let me take a look.

650
00:43:48,583 --> 00:43:49,958
Please, help, Nurse.

651
00:43:50,041 --> 00:43:52,333
Excuse me, Ma’am. Let me check.

652
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:56,083
What’s she doing to me?

653
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:59,458
It’s the next dilation. Dilation four.

654
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,250
-Praise God!
-Praise God!

655
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,750
Thank you, Nurse.

656
00:44:07,416 --> 00:44:08,708
I said rub my tummy. You have one job!

657
00:44:08,791 --> 00:44:09,833
Yes, yes, yes.

658
00:44:20,666 --> 00:44:22,125
Oh, shit!

659
00:44:50,291 --> 00:44:51,708
Hey, where are you going?

660
00:44:54,541 --> 00:44:56,541
Hey, stupid head! Come here!

661
00:45:01,375 --> 00:45:03,083
Where are you going?

662
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,583
Hey, stupid head! Hey!

663
00:46:47,041 --> 00:46:47,958
Hey!

664
00:46:53,833 --> 00:46:58,000
Why are you hiding from me?

665
00:46:58,333 --> 00:47:00,041
Alam, listen to me.

666
00:47:00,666 --> 00:47:05,625
It drives me crazy
when people talk about responsibility.

667
00:47:05,916 --> 00:47:07,750
You and your job.
What kind of a job is it?

668
00:47:10,333 --> 00:47:15,958
You wear shorts, you make calls.

669
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:19,458
What will people think of that?
What is your job anyway?

670
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:24,583
Stop giggling.

671
00:47:25,833 --> 00:47:29,041
How am I supposed to believe in you?
Stupid head!

672
00:47:34,583 --> 00:47:38,208
I’ve always known
you never believed in me.

673
00:47:40,583 --> 00:47:44,125
When Mia got pregnant,
I never had the chance to apologize.

674
00:47:44,208 --> 00:47:48,583
You couldn’t even speak properly!

675
00:47:50,041 --> 00:47:52,333
And whose fault is that, stupid?

676
00:47:52,625 --> 00:47:55,000
I was about to tell you

677
00:47:55,958 --> 00:47:59,416
that I will be responsible.
I won't run away.

678
00:48:02,625 --> 00:48:04,166
What is this?

679
00:48:25,666 --> 00:48:27,708
What is that?

680
00:48:28,083 --> 00:48:31,166
Wait, Dad!

681
00:48:44,416 --> 00:48:47,250
What is this thing?
Let’s take another whiff.

682
00:48:49,208 --> 00:48:52,041
So good!

683
00:48:52,125 --> 00:48:55,458
I can even play golf now, see?

684
00:49:02,666 --> 00:49:04,041
What is this?

685
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:11,875
Oh my God.

686
00:49:11,958 --> 00:49:16,125
I came here so that you’d learn something
about responsibility.

687
00:49:16,666 --> 00:49:17,583
Yes.

688
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:22,708
That’s a baby coming out of her!
Not some… poop!

689
00:49:25,125 --> 00:49:26,375
Poop?

690
00:49:28,083 --> 00:49:30,583
-Stop giggling!
-That’s your child!

691
00:49:32,541 --> 00:49:33,541
Hey your mouth got twisted again.

692
00:49:36,291 --> 00:49:40,791
Ouch, it hurts. Get up. Get up!

693
00:49:45,083 --> 00:49:48,625
I’m not running from my responsibility.

694
00:49:49,083 --> 00:49:51,708
I’m not going anywhere.

695
00:49:52,583 --> 00:49:57,916
N2O is not a toy!
You understand?

696
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,291
People call it laughing gas.

697
00:50:00,958 --> 00:50:05,250
It’s an alternative anesthetic
for surgery.

698
00:50:05,333 --> 00:50:08,583
For normal births.

699
00:50:08,666 --> 00:50:11,166
Not something to play with!

700
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:12,291
For laughing?

701
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,958
Hey!

702
00:50:18,708 --> 00:50:19,791
It’s not a comedy show!

703
00:50:19,875 --> 00:50:21,000
I apologize.

704
00:50:21,083 --> 00:50:25,416
Not accepted! What is this, Idul Fitri?

705
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:30,625
You’re laughing,
but I'm the one management will be mad at!

706
00:50:30,708 --> 00:50:33,541
If they find out,
they’ll kill me right now!

707
00:50:34,208 --> 00:50:35,250
Poor guy.

708
00:50:35,875 --> 00:50:41,250
Yes, poor me! Listen, you’re all grown up.
You’re an old man.

709
00:50:41,333 --> 00:50:45,166
And what’s with your inside
out shirt and homeless pants?

710
00:50:46,041 --> 00:50:47,208
I am so sorry, Sir.

711
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:52,500
Forget it.
Don’t let me see you back here again.

712
00:50:52,583 --> 00:50:54,625
I’m warning you. I will not call security,

713
00:50:54,708 --> 00:50:57,041
-I’ll have the army come and bomb you!
-Sorry, Sir.

714
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:58,958
“Sorry, Sir.”

715
00:51:05,916 --> 00:51:09,500
Why did you run away
to Mia’s uncle in Surabaya?

716
00:51:10,916 --> 00:51:11,750
How did you know that?

717
00:51:11,833 --> 00:51:15,875
I know everything.

718
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,625
Listen, let’s call a truce, okay.

719
00:51:19,708 --> 00:51:25,041
For my grandchild.

720
00:51:27,041 --> 00:51:30,958
As long as you know what you have to do.

721
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,041
No more war between us.

722
00:51:34,708 --> 00:51:37,750
All you have to do is trust me.
Everything will be okay.

723
00:51:37,833 --> 00:51:38,916
Alright.

724
00:51:39,708 --> 00:51:42,833
-But can I ask you one more thing?
-What?

725
00:51:42,916 --> 00:51:45,833
Let’s take a selfie.
As a symbol of peace.

726
00:51:46,708 --> 00:51:51,791
Let everybody see. Smile! Look happy!

727
00:51:56,916 --> 00:51:57,875
Say cheese!

728
00:51:59,541 --> 00:52:00,458
We’re leaving now.

729
00:52:00,541 --> 00:52:03,208
Yes, take care.

730
00:52:04,541 --> 00:52:05,708
Come on.

731
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:10,416
-We're leaving.
-Take care of her.

732
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:13,166
-Get your phone on stand by.
-I'm leaving now.

733
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:16,541
-Take care, dear.
-Thank you.

734
00:52:16,625 --> 00:52:20,000
-Bye. Everyone.
-Bye.

735
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:23,291
Thank you, everyone.

736
00:52:24,166 --> 00:52:29,041
Sari? I can do the revision,
no need to delegate to Coki.

737
00:52:29,541 --> 00:52:34,583
Yes. Seriously.
But, can you help with my points?

738
00:52:36,541 --> 00:52:37,916
Okay, bye.

739
00:52:43,833 --> 00:52:45,666
I’m sad, you know.

740
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:49,250
You’re about to give birth

741
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:52,125
and you’re still working.

742
00:52:52,541 --> 00:52:55,166
Typing away. It’s almost time.

743
00:52:57,041 --> 00:53:00,041
How will you focus on the delivery?

744
00:53:00,541 --> 00:53:01,833
I am focused.

745
00:53:03,333 --> 00:53:05,750
-And that boy husband of yours.
-Alam!

746
00:53:05,833 --> 00:53:09,791
I’m talking about his job, not his name.
Has he found a proper office job?

747
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,208
-Mom!
-What?

748
00:53:16,666 --> 00:53:17,875
You’re so insensitive!

749
00:53:17,958 --> 00:53:20,416
I thought she’d left with everybody.

750
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:21,416
Of course she hasn’t!

751
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:24,166
How was I supposed to know?
Everybody was saying goodbye.

752
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:25,416
I'm focused on you!

753
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:40,583
How’s Mia? Are you a father yet?

754
00:53:42,916 --> 00:53:43,750
Erik, what are you doing here?

755
00:53:44,208 --> 00:53:46,583
Well, aren’t you friendly?

756
00:53:46,833 --> 00:53:48,500
I told you I was behind you.

757
00:53:52,833 --> 00:53:53,833
Look.

758
00:53:54,291 --> 00:53:59,041
Something's wrong with your shirt.

759
00:54:00,291 --> 00:54:02,291
My shirt, my business.

760
00:54:04,208 --> 00:54:07,000
You’re here for that politician,
aren’t you?

761
00:54:07,208 --> 00:54:08,541
I saw his car in the parking lot earlier.

762
00:54:09,416 --> 00:54:12,125
I’m here for you, bro.

763
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,500
Well, after that,
I’ll see Mr. Bimo from Commission I.

764
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,083
Heart problems. Bypass surgery.
Politics is hard, bro.

765
00:54:26,166 --> 00:54:28,375
Listen, I’m actually here to help you out.

766
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,541
I know you’re fighting over a project
with Amrin.

767
00:54:33,208 --> 00:54:35,708
You do it, I’ll give you a pre-order.

768
00:54:36,833 --> 00:54:39,083
I have to go. Let’s go.

769
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:40,875
No, no.

770
00:54:47,041 --> 00:54:51,291
I can manage. Go back to your friend.

771
00:54:57,041 --> 00:54:59,291
Alam,

772
00:55:02,375 --> 00:55:07,250
call this man.
He’ll win the governor election.

773
00:55:07,333 --> 00:55:12,041
I’m on his team. Call him,
and he’ll order your book. Seriously.

774
00:55:12,458 --> 00:55:13,458
What’s he going to do?

775
00:55:14,291 --> 00:55:20,208
Just call him. Mention my name.
He can help you with that lawsuit.

776
00:55:20,458 --> 00:55:24,416
What's the position you're after, man?
Tell me.

777
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:27,166
How could you think that about me?

778
00:55:27,416 --> 00:55:28,708
My intention is pure.

779
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:30,583
I’m making up

780
00:55:30,666 --> 00:55:33,625
for that time I beat you to the
Editor-in-Chief position.

781
00:55:34,458 --> 00:55:35,875
-Say hi to Mia for me.
-Wait, what?

782
00:55:35,958 --> 00:55:36,875
I have to go.

783
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:38,666
Aren’t you here to see Mia?

784
00:55:39,583 --> 00:55:40,583
Yeah, maybe later.

785
00:55:54,708 --> 00:55:57,125
Honey, can I borrow your laptop for a sec?

786
00:55:57,208 --> 00:55:58,166
Where’s yours?

787
00:55:58,875 --> 00:56:01,875
It’s in service.
I’m adding some extra RAM for speed.

788
00:56:02,375 --> 00:56:03,666
But you had it with you earlier.

789
00:56:03,916 --> 00:56:05,666
Yes, I did.

790
00:56:05,958 --> 00:56:08,916
But I gave it to Gugun for service.

791
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,083
Gugun was here? When?

792
00:56:11,166 --> 00:56:12,541
Earlier, he didn’t stay long.

793
00:56:12,625 --> 00:56:16,250
I need to work on this important book
so I’ll get the advance soon.

794
00:56:16,833 --> 00:56:20,500
Give it to him, child.

795
00:56:21,583 --> 00:56:22,708
It's his opportunity.

796
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:31,875
I’ll guard it with my life.

797
00:56:33,916 --> 00:56:35,583
Thank you, Dad.

798
00:56:36,583 --> 00:56:37,583
Good luck.

799
00:56:38,625 --> 00:56:40,208
Silly boy.

800
00:56:40,666 --> 00:56:41,958
Nice room, right?

801
00:56:42,625 --> 00:56:45,041
You can lie down and relax.

802
00:56:45,791 --> 00:56:46,708
It still smells like paint.

803
00:56:47,458 --> 00:56:48,541
Take care.

804
00:56:50,333 --> 00:56:54,041
It's okay, dear.

805
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:05,916
-Mom! It hurts!
-What happened?

806
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,708
-What’s wrong?
-Mia!

807
00:57:11,083 --> 00:57:13,208
Hold her hand.

808
00:57:13,583 --> 00:57:15,458
Hold her hand.

809
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:17,291
What do I press?

810
00:57:17,583 --> 00:57:20,583
-Which one?
-Press that one.

811
00:57:20,666 --> 00:57:23,416
Nurse!

812
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:24,625
Let me check, Ma’am.

813
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:26,208
Alright.

814
00:57:26,541 --> 00:57:29,000
Hold. Breathe.

815
00:57:29,958 --> 00:57:31,250
Breathe.

816
00:57:31,333 --> 00:57:34,125
-Don’t just stand around.
-Yes, Sir.

817
00:57:34,458 --> 00:57:36,625
Dilation five!

818
00:57:36,708 --> 00:57:41,791
Praise God!

819
00:57:43,125 --> 00:57:46,125
I got carried away.

820
00:57:46,208 --> 00:57:48,125
Hang in there, Ma’am. It’s almost over.

821
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:17,083
-Hello?
-Hello, is this Alam?

822
00:58:17,166 --> 00:58:18,333
This is he.

823
00:58:18,416 --> 00:58:21,125
I’m Nugraha, Faisal’s lawyer.

824
00:58:21,208 --> 00:58:23,166
We would like to file a lawsuit,

825
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:26,458
because you have not shown
any good intention so far.

826
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:33,291
What’s your problem?

827
00:58:36,916 --> 00:58:38,541
Looking good. Be careful.

828
00:58:39,916 --> 00:58:42,958
Up, up. Be careful now.

829
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:46,208
Yes, be careful.

830
00:58:46,291 --> 00:58:47,916
Can I have a glass, please?

831
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:50,375
Alright, up.

832
00:58:51,708 --> 00:58:52,875
Up.

833
00:59:03,708 --> 00:59:08,625
If you do not respond
to Faisal’s request within 24 hours,

834
00:59:08,708 --> 00:59:10,083
we will serve you with the lawsuit.

835
00:59:15,041 --> 00:59:16,625
Okay, lift it up.

836
00:59:17,958 --> 00:59:19,125
Lift it up.

837
00:59:20,208 --> 00:59:22,375
Watch out for the iron bar.

838
00:59:22,875 --> 00:59:27,375
Hey! Watch out!

839
00:59:50,583 --> 00:59:52,166
Never mind.

840
00:59:54,333 --> 00:59:58,250
-Some more?
-I’m good, thanks.

841
00:59:58,333 --> 01:00:00,875
Fine, leave it there.
She’ll have more later.

842
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Mia, how can I change your mind?
Have a C-section.

843
01:00:10,083 --> 01:00:11,333
No, Mom.

844
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:16,083
Why? The goal is the same.
To get the baby out.

845
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:18,000
I said, no, Mom.

846
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:22,541
If you and the boy have no money,
your dad and I will help.

847
01:00:22,625 --> 01:00:23,750
We have money for you, don’t worry--

848
01:00:23,833 --> 01:00:26,833
Mom, I’m having a normal birth.

849
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:30,125
End of discussion.

850
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:41,166
I knew it.

851
01:00:43,333 --> 01:00:45,750
How did you know I was here?

852
01:00:45,833 --> 01:00:49,916
Please. I gave birth to you.

853
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:57,375
I carried you for nine months.
I can find you anywhere.

854
01:00:58,250 --> 01:00:59,291
What are you working on?

855
01:01:00,625 --> 01:01:03,041
Just some work.

856
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:10,250
-Alam.
-Yes?

857
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:13,291
Can I have a light?

858
01:01:13,958 --> 01:01:15,375
-For God’s sake.
-Why?

859
01:01:15,458 --> 01:01:17,458
You can’t smoke in a hospital!
Behave, please.

860
01:01:17,541 --> 01:01:19,125
Oh come on.

861
01:01:19,833 --> 01:01:20,791
Here, have this.

862
01:01:22,333 --> 01:01:24,041
-What’s this?
-Try it.

863
01:01:28,125 --> 01:01:29,791
Hell.

864
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,333
I’m supposed to chew on this?

865
01:01:34,875 --> 01:01:36,083
What am I, an old lady?

866
01:01:40,208 --> 01:01:42,666
What’re you working on? Why so serious?

867
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:44,041
Zee Zag’s book.

868
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,250
Do you still remember this scarf?

869
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:55,458
Yeah. It’s as old as I am.
Grandma gave you the fabric...

870
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:01,541
Then what?
Don’t you get tired of telling that story?

871
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,083
Give me something else.
A fairy tale or something.

872
01:02:05,083 --> 01:02:10,541
Because there’s a part
I haven’t told you yet.

873
01:02:10,833 --> 01:02:12,083
What?

874
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,833
It was a tough time.

875
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:26,416
The doctor was about
to give me something to abort you.

876
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:37,208
He said it was a high-risk pregnancy.

877
01:02:40,291 --> 01:02:44,958
But I was sure,

878
01:02:49,666 --> 01:02:53,833
every baby deserves a chance.

879
01:02:57,333 --> 01:02:59,625
We can never escape our children.

880
01:03:02,041 --> 01:03:03,583
Never.

881
01:03:08,875 --> 01:03:12,416
A child is more than just a blessing.

882
01:03:14,166 --> 01:03:17,000
It’s not something you search for.

883
01:03:17,416 --> 01:03:19,500
It’s something you receive.

884
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:26,375
You brought this child into the world.

885
01:03:40,125 --> 01:03:41,125
Hey.

886
01:03:43,875 --> 01:03:45,083
Don’t forget to eat.

887
01:03:46,416 --> 01:03:51,250
Before you’re responsible for your child,
be responsible to yourself.

888
01:03:51,791 --> 01:03:54,000
Okay? I’m going back in.

889
01:03:55,458 --> 01:03:58,416
Ma, can I borrow five bucks?

890
01:03:59,666 --> 01:04:01,083
Dear God...

891
01:04:08,083 --> 01:04:10,583
-Here, take it all.
-Oh, some extra?

892
01:04:14,875 --> 01:04:16,625
-Thank you, Ma.
-I’ll see you inside.

893
01:04:16,708 --> 01:04:17,583
Okay.

894
01:04:52,916 --> 01:04:54,000
What, Erik?

895
01:04:54,083 --> 01:04:56,250
You’re still in touch with
the Forum Progress guys, right?

896
01:04:56,875 --> 01:04:58,541
I need to mobilize a crowd.

897
01:04:58,625 --> 01:05:00,875
You know the Kaliandri scandal?

898
01:05:01,375 --> 01:05:03,000
I have to organize
a counter demonstration.

899
01:05:03,083 --> 01:05:05,916
And I need a crowd.
They’re still radical, right?

900
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,166
Can you pull some strings?
This is the perfect angle. Human rights.

901
01:05:09,833 --> 01:05:12,458
How many times have you asked me
this favor?

902
01:05:12,791 --> 01:05:14,708
Same answer from me. No.

903
01:05:15,166 --> 01:05:18,083
You need the pre-order
from my government friend, right?

904
01:05:18,333 --> 01:05:21,041
You want to get paid or not?

905
01:05:21,708 --> 01:05:26,166
I checked with the hospital cashier.
You’re still 400 bucks short, right?

906
01:05:26,291 --> 01:05:27,375
Indeed.

907
01:05:29,916 --> 01:05:32,875
Hey, Sir?
Where are you taking that trolley?

908
01:05:32,958 --> 01:05:36,750
-Oh, no. Just my laptop.
-You can’t take it with you.

909
01:05:36,833 --> 01:05:37,833
-Yes, sorry, Nurse.
-It's okay.

910
01:05:40,125 --> 01:05:41,708
-Are you serious or not?
-I’m serious, Mr. Fuad.

911
01:05:41,791 --> 01:05:45,375
-I'm not sure.
-I emailed you the pre-order.

912
01:05:45,875 --> 01:05:47,833
You just prepare the schedule.

913
01:05:47,916 --> 01:05:51,333
I’ll send over the text tonight
or tomorrow morning.

914
01:05:51,958 --> 01:05:52,875
Good, send it.

915
01:05:52,958 --> 01:05:56,000
See? I bet you’re smiling over there.
I can feel it.

916
01:05:56,083 --> 01:05:57,833
It won’t be long now.

917
01:05:57,916 --> 01:05:59,375
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

918
01:06:05,541 --> 01:06:07,916
FINALLY. A GOOD CAFETERIA MEAL
AFTER A WHOLE DAY WAITING FOR CONTRACTION.

919
01:06:20,416 --> 01:06:23,458
FINALLY. A GOOD CAFETERIA MEAL
AFTER A WHOLE DAY WAITING FOR CONTRACTION

920
01:06:27,458 --> 01:06:29,416
Hey! Alam Tanjung.

921
01:06:30,791 --> 01:06:31,708
Stay right there!

922
01:06:32,833 --> 01:06:35,625
David has fled.
Boss Nandi is black and blue.

923
01:06:35,708 --> 01:06:38,500
-Don’t you run away, punk!
-No, no.

924
01:06:51,333 --> 01:06:53,208
Don't run, you son of a bitch!

925
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:55,916
How?

926
01:06:56,375 --> 01:06:57,666
Dilation six.

927
01:06:57,750 --> 01:06:59,708
-Really?
-Praise God!

928
01:06:59,791 --> 01:07:03,291
-We’re getting closer.
-Thank God!

929
01:07:03,375 --> 01:07:05,583
Mrs. Mia?

930
01:07:05,666 --> 01:07:09,083
-Sister?
-She’s losing energy.

931
01:07:16,708 --> 01:07:18,791
Hey, don’t run!

932
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:27,250
Hurry, get him

933
01:07:32,166 --> 01:07:33,333
Hurry up!

934
01:07:35,791 --> 01:07:36,833
Son of a bitch!

935
01:07:53,958 --> 01:07:58,375
Let’s take a break. Chill.

936
01:07:58,458 --> 01:08:00,041
Easy. Take a break.

937
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:02,958
Hey, don’t run!

938
01:08:05,916 --> 01:08:09,416
Hey, don't run!

939
01:08:13,416 --> 01:08:15,041
Run!

940
01:08:47,791 --> 01:08:49,041
Hey!

941
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:51,583
-Where are you going to go?
-Come on, Mom!

942
01:08:53,416 --> 01:08:56,625
Mom, come on! Which floor?
Let me press the button.

943
01:08:56,708 --> 01:08:58,500
-37.
-37?

944
01:09:05,666 --> 01:09:08,791
Sorry, gentlemen. Kids being kids.

945
01:09:08,875 --> 01:09:10,000
It’s okay.

946
01:09:11,458 --> 01:09:12,458
No worries, Ma’am.

947
01:09:13,083 --> 01:09:14,500
So soft.

948
01:09:15,166 --> 01:09:16,666
Who are you seeing?

949
01:09:17,375 --> 01:09:18,416
A family member.

950
01:09:19,875 --> 01:09:21,250
-Kids being kids.
-Yes, Ma'am.

951
01:09:24,458 --> 01:09:26,500
Hey, stop!

952
01:09:29,791 --> 01:09:31,000
Hey, stop!

953
01:09:33,083 --> 01:09:35,708
Are you sure you want to change hospitals?

954
01:09:35,791 --> 01:09:40,583
I’m sure.
Can you give this to that young man?

955
01:09:40,916 --> 01:09:42,541
-Of course.
-Thank you, Nurse.

956
01:09:59,208 --> 01:10:00,166
-Alam?
-What wrong?

957
01:10:02,708 --> 01:10:04,166
Where are you going now?

958
01:10:04,875 --> 01:10:08,000
-Nowhere to run.
-Gotcha!

959
01:10:08,083 --> 01:10:09,708
Shut up. I don’t need to hear your shit.

960
01:10:09,791 --> 01:10:11,791
-My wife’s pregnant.
-I want my collateral.

961
01:10:11,875 --> 01:10:12,916
Where’s your car key?

962
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,125
Or give me that laptop!

963
01:10:16,208 --> 01:10:18,083
Get out of the way!

964
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:24,041
Are you okay?

965
01:10:24,125 --> 01:10:25,166
You woke up the beast!

966
01:10:27,416 --> 01:10:29,833
Oh my God, what is she doing?

967
01:10:33,250 --> 01:10:36,166
Don’t piss me off.
How dare you hit my son?

968
01:10:38,291 --> 01:10:41,875
Easy, lady.
I’m here to ask him for collateral.

969
01:10:42,833 --> 01:10:43,708
Where are his car keys?

970
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:48,041
Your son is deep in debt, you know that?

971
01:10:50,833 --> 01:10:52,166
Give him the car keys, honey.

972
01:10:54,708 --> 01:10:56,500
Just give him them.

973
01:11:01,041 --> 01:11:02,333
The car is with Ivan.

974
01:11:03,333 --> 01:11:07,041
-Hey, don’t start any trouble here.
-No trouble, Sir. Relax.

975
01:11:07,458 --> 01:11:11,333
-Come with me.
-Hands off! I can walk by myself.

976
01:11:11,416 --> 01:11:14,750
This is not over yet. I’m onto you!

977
01:11:14,833 --> 01:11:15,958
Take them out, Sir.

978
01:11:16,083 --> 01:11:18,750
Easy!

979
01:11:20,875 --> 01:11:23,333
You parked the car at Ivan’s house?

980
01:11:24,333 --> 01:11:25,250
Yes, honey.

981
01:11:25,583 --> 01:11:27,833
You’re dealing with that loan shark again?

982
01:11:30,333 --> 01:11:33,458
You promised me, Alam. You swore to me.

983
01:11:34,166 --> 01:11:36,500
I know, honey.

984
01:11:36,833 --> 01:11:39,916
What about that book deal?
Is that even real?

985
01:11:43,708 --> 01:11:45,000
Let me explain.

986
01:11:45,583 --> 01:11:46,916
This is a baby, Alam.

987
01:11:49,041 --> 01:11:51,916
Not a wedding organizer who you can charm.

988
01:11:53,791 --> 01:11:55,708
Not your Twitter followers.

989
01:11:57,083 --> 01:12:00,125
This is a baby, Alam! It’s that simple.

990
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:02,000
Not a doll.

991
01:12:02,083 --> 01:12:04,166
Won’t you let me explain?

992
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:05,625
What else to explain?

993
01:12:08,166 --> 01:12:10,250
This is what you’re good at.

994
01:12:11,625 --> 01:12:13,083
Making up excuses.

995
01:12:14,708 --> 01:12:19,208
If I got a dictionary
and look up the word “excuses”,

996
01:12:19,291 --> 01:12:20,833
I bet I’d find your face there!

997
01:12:24,291 --> 01:12:25,541
Are you even telling the truth now?

998
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:29,458
Or is it more lies?

999
01:12:32,083 --> 01:12:33,125
More deceit?

1000
01:12:40,041 --> 01:12:41,208
I’m sorry.

1001
01:12:41,625 --> 01:12:42,541
Get out. Get out!

1002
01:12:53,083 --> 01:12:54,000
Get out!

1003
01:12:54,875 --> 01:12:55,708
Easy, child.

1004
01:13:00,708 --> 01:13:02,333
Come. Come.

1005
01:13:14,541 --> 01:13:17,541
Just lie down.

1006
01:13:18,291 --> 01:13:19,291
Just lie down.

1007
01:13:27,375 --> 01:13:31,000
-It hurts.
-It's okay.

1008
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,833
-Nurse.
-Yes, Ma’am?

1009
01:14:12,541 --> 01:14:13,541
CALLING ERIK

1010
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:24,875
Well?

1011
01:14:24,958 --> 01:14:27,708
Hello, Erik. How many people do you need?

1012
01:14:28,375 --> 01:14:30,166
You have any bail plan?

1013
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,375
Where’s your post? What kind of exit plan?

1014
01:14:33,833 --> 01:14:35,583
And my fee excludes meal.

1015
01:14:35,666 --> 01:14:40,125
Whoa, slow down. For a guy
who’s not a player, you’re pretty savvy.

1016
01:14:40,208 --> 01:14:43,000
You slow down.
I may not be a capitalist like you,

1017
01:14:43,083 --> 01:14:45,750
but I know my stuff.
Keynes? Smith? Who else?

1018
01:14:45,833 --> 01:14:48,791
Okay, let me check about your questions.
For details.

1019
01:14:48,875 --> 01:14:51,125
I’ll let you know.
But make sure you provide the crowd.

1020
01:14:52,166 --> 01:14:56,291
-Make sure you transfer my money first.
-Consider it done.

1021
01:14:56,375 --> 01:14:59,958
Got it, bro.
I’ll bring my crowd and the equipment.

1022
01:15:00,041 --> 01:15:01,375
I got another demonstration next week.
Will you be my guy?

1023
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:04,583
At the district court.
They ask for grassroots crowd.

1024
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:08,166
So you finally got realistic now?
The baby’s got power over you.

1025
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:25,541
All right, I’ll be right there.
Room 3310, right? Yes, Ma’am. Thank you.

1026
01:15:25,625 --> 01:15:31,375
Mr. Alam! I was just looking for you.
I wanted to give you this, from Mrs. Dian.

1027
01:15:32,125 --> 01:15:33,333
Who’s Mrs. Dian?

1028
01:15:33,416 --> 01:15:35,791
You went to her room by mistake earlier?

1029
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:39,541
But, sorry, I kind of read the letter.

1030
01:15:39,625 --> 01:15:45,458
She thanks you for
reminding her about responsibility.

1031
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:48,208
That’s about it.
I have to go see a patient.

1032
01:15:52,708 --> 01:15:53,791
Nurse?

1033
01:16:13,916 --> 01:16:15,500
Just pray for everything.

1034
01:16:26,333 --> 01:16:32,083
So, Mrs. Dian has moved
to a clinic nearby.

1035
01:16:32,416 --> 01:16:34,750
So she can save some money.

1036
01:16:35,583 --> 01:16:38,916
She changed her mind because of you.

1037
01:16:39,333 --> 01:16:43,708
She’s done worrying
about what her neighbors say.

1038
01:16:43,791 --> 01:16:45,833
About her husband not being here.

1039
01:16:46,250 --> 01:16:48,166
That’s why she came
to this hospital in the first place.

1040
01:16:49,083 --> 01:16:51,583
For more prestige.

1041
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:54,625
Hey, hold it up.

1042
01:16:55,166 --> 01:16:59,041
I also learned a lot from you, by the way.

1043
01:16:59,125 --> 01:17:01,791
When you tweeted about online cabs?

1044
01:17:02,125 --> 01:17:04,708
My husband didn’t join
the demonstration because of it.

1045
01:17:04,791 --> 01:17:07,750
See, your tweets made a difference.

1046
01:17:13,083 --> 01:17:14,333
I need to check this.

1047
01:17:14,916 --> 01:17:16,208
-Here.
-Just a minute.

1048
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,333
What’s your bank account number?

1049
01:17:35,125 --> 01:17:39,208
Mia, everything is meant to be.

1050
01:17:40,875 --> 01:17:45,208
It’s your destiny to have
that boy as your husband.

1051
01:17:46,625 --> 01:17:47,750
What can you do?

1052
01:17:48,916 --> 01:17:51,000
You have to be the stronger one.

1053
01:17:52,916 --> 01:17:56,041
When the baby’s here,

1054
01:17:56,125 --> 01:17:59,416
you can stay at our house.

1055
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:02,166
With your dad and me.
And the baby. All of us together.

1056
01:18:02,666 --> 01:18:08,083
I can help take care of the baby.
I’ll help you out.

1057
01:18:08,791 --> 01:18:09,750
Yes, Mom.

1058
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:14,125
I’m good with babies.
I’ll do it at your house.

1059
01:18:14,791 --> 01:18:15,791
Yes, Mom.

1060
01:18:16,916 --> 01:18:19,791
You still have your room at our house.

1061
01:18:20,833 --> 01:18:25,208
You can stay there.
We’ll change the sheets and everything.

1062
01:18:30,125 --> 01:18:32,708
YOUR BANK ACCOUNT NUMBER?
I’LL TRANSFER THE MONEY NOW.

1063
01:18:36,666 --> 01:18:37,583
The usual.

1064
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:52,666
Try some.

1065
01:18:57,208 --> 01:19:01,583
I’ve always wanted to taste one of these.
Those foreign contractors like them.

1066
01:19:17,833 --> 01:19:20,791
What’s wrong? You look a mess.

1067
01:19:25,083 --> 01:19:26,333
My wife’s about to give birth.

1068
01:19:33,333 --> 01:19:34,250
Your first?

1069
01:19:37,625 --> 01:19:38,875
Just like Marno.

1070
01:19:41,416 --> 01:19:44,083
My crane operator who had the accident.

1071
01:19:45,375 --> 01:19:50,291
Three days, working overtime, no sleep.

1072
01:19:51,583 --> 01:19:54,916
He’s with his baby now,
but he’s hospitalized.

1073
01:20:00,041 --> 01:20:02,083
He missed out on the birth.

1074
01:20:04,708 --> 01:20:09,958
Because of the accident,

1075
01:20:10,041 --> 01:20:13,166
we can’t lift our stuff up.

1076
01:20:15,416 --> 01:20:18,041
No other crane operators are available.

1077
01:20:20,375 --> 01:20:23,250
We have the money.

1078
01:20:27,208 --> 01:20:29,458
400 bucks isn't bad, right?

1079
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,583
Jakarta is full
of construction right now.

1080
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,666
Everybody’s busy.

1081
01:20:49,416 --> 01:20:50,500
Sorry, I’m rambling.

1082
01:21:01,083 --> 01:21:03,666
Are you having a boy or a girl?

1083
01:21:05,708 --> 01:21:06,666
We don’t know yet.

1084
01:21:08,833 --> 01:21:10,166
You like surprises, huh?

1085
01:21:11,541 --> 01:21:14,666
Whether it’s a boy or a girl,

1086
01:21:15,125 --> 01:21:18,833
it’ll be proud of you.

1087
01:21:23,041 --> 01:21:25,416
Its dad can manage.

1088
01:21:27,875 --> 01:21:31,500
He’s there when it arrives.

1089
01:21:43,833 --> 01:21:46,333
What was that you say?
About the 400 bucks?

1090
01:21:50,541 --> 01:21:51,625
The 400 bucks.

1091
01:21:52,375 --> 01:21:55,333
-Yes?
-Have you got your guy?

1092
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:01,750
-Excuse me.
-Good evening.

1093
01:22:01,833 --> 01:22:03,208
Hi, Doctor.

1094
01:22:03,583 --> 01:22:04,958
How’s everything?

1095
01:22:05,541 --> 01:22:07,500
How is her condition?

1096
01:22:07,583 --> 01:22:10,083
It must already be dilation eight.

1097
01:22:11,083 --> 01:22:15,500
But I think it’s stuck.
Mrs. Mia has also lost her energy.

1098
01:22:15,583 --> 01:22:16,583
We don’t want that.

1099
01:22:18,125 --> 01:22:19,625
-Doctor?
-Yes?

1100
01:22:20,083 --> 01:22:21,625
Can I still have a normal birth?

1101
01:22:21,708 --> 01:22:24,833
It’s easy to do something about the pain.

1102
01:22:25,125 --> 01:22:27,875
But you have to keep your spirits up,
and have faith in yourself,

1103
01:22:27,958 --> 01:22:32,541
believe you can do it.
I’ll be right here to help. Okay?

1104
01:22:34,708 --> 01:22:36,500
You can do it, Mrs. Mia.

1105
01:22:38,583 --> 01:22:39,583
Who would’ve thought?

1106
01:22:40,208 --> 01:22:43,750
My random rambling
has found me a replacement.

1107
01:22:51,291 --> 01:22:53,333
You’ve operated this type before, right?

1108
01:22:53,416 --> 01:22:56,208
Yes, when I was in Dubai.

1109
01:22:56,291 --> 01:22:59,000
Thank God. This is great news.

1110
01:23:02,208 --> 01:23:04,958
Come on, man.

1111
01:23:31,875 --> 01:23:32,958
-All good?
-It’s ready.

1112
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:37,333
Hey, man, thanks for doing this.

1113
01:23:37,416 --> 01:23:41,625
Otherwise we won’t get our pay.
Thanks so much, man!

1114
01:23:41,708 --> 01:23:42,916
-Thank you, man!
-You’re welcome.

1115
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:44,708
We really appreciate it!

1116
01:23:45,416 --> 01:23:47,291
Come on, hurry up.

1117
01:23:50,208 --> 01:23:52,916
Those dealing with the crane,
take your position.

1118
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Come on.

1119
01:24:23,750 --> 01:24:25,250
Shit, this is high.

1120
01:24:51,291 --> 01:24:53,500
Okay, Dubai Schmubai! Fuck it.

1121
01:25:21,250 --> 01:25:24,000
Alam, are you okay there?

1122
01:25:25,208 --> 01:25:26,375
What’s taking so long?

1123
01:25:28,583 --> 01:25:30,833
Can you operate it or not?

1124
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:34,458
Relax. I’m saying a little prayer.

1125
01:26:03,875 --> 01:26:04,791
Oh, okay.

1126
01:26:06,833 --> 01:26:10,416
Something wrong? Why so unsteady?

1127
01:26:12,333 --> 01:26:16,000
Alam? Are you still alive?

1128
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:19,791
I’m getting to know this baby.

1129
01:26:19,875 --> 01:26:21,250
It’s different than the one in Dubai.

1130
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:23,833
Okay.

1131
01:26:48,791 --> 01:26:50,708
It's Nugraha, Faisal’s lawyer.

1132
01:26:50,958 --> 01:26:54,916
Where do I send the lawsuit?
To the hospital or where?

1133
01:27:55,458 --> 01:27:58,000
To the left, Alam. Left.

1134
01:27:59,583 --> 01:28:02,375
Steady. Hold it.

1135
01:28:03,583 --> 01:28:06,791
Swing left, slowly.

1136
01:28:08,291 --> 01:28:10,583
Yes, swing right slowly.

1137
01:28:10,666 --> 01:28:13,416
Forward, Alam, forward.

1138
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:19,041
Hold it. Smoothly now.

1139
01:28:20,250 --> 01:28:21,583
Almost there. Get it down.

1140
01:28:22,333 --> 01:28:25,041
It’s getting there. Down. Down.

1141
01:28:25,458 --> 01:28:26,875
Take it down now.

1142
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:31,791
Easy.

1143
01:28:32,791 --> 01:28:36,416
Go on. Smoothly.

1144
01:28:36,791 --> 01:28:38,916
Easy.

1145
01:28:43,583 --> 01:28:45,291
Come on, man. Yes.

1146
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,833
Yes, okay. We got it!

1147
01:29:28,250 --> 01:29:29,208
I’m sorry.

1148
01:29:30,083 --> 01:29:33,833
I can only pay you 200 bucks.

1149
01:29:34,291 --> 01:29:39,583
We used half of the money
for Marno’s hospital admission.

1150
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:50,541
Hey, the helmet!

1151
01:30:04,541 --> 01:30:06,875
-Mia! Honey!
-Alam.

1152
01:30:06,958 --> 01:30:07,916
Mia!

1153
01:30:12,416 --> 01:30:14,416
-Mia honey!
-Alam!

1154
01:30:14,916 --> 01:30:19,583
Honey, you can have a normal birth.
I’ve bought the N2O tube.

1155
01:30:19,666 --> 01:30:23,250
You can ask the nurse what it’s for.
It’s for normal births, honey.

1156
01:30:23,916 --> 01:30:26,541
I’m sure a thousand percent
you can give birth normally.

1157
01:30:26,625 --> 01:30:28,583
A thousand percent!
You’ve got to have your normal birth.

1158
01:30:28,666 --> 01:30:29,958
-Sir, this is as far as you can go.
-Please wait here.

1159
01:30:30,041 --> 01:30:31,333
That’s my husband.

1160
01:30:31,625 --> 01:30:33,208
Nurse, explain about the N2O. Nurse!

1161
01:30:33,291 --> 01:30:35,333
Yes, I know, but your husband can’t go in.
for hygiene reasons.

1162
01:30:35,416 --> 01:30:37,208
What was he talking about?

1163
01:30:37,291 --> 01:30:41,083
The N2O will make you more relaxed.
It makes the process easier for you. Okay?

1164
01:30:58,291 --> 01:30:59,291
Please.

1165
01:31:02,250 --> 01:31:04,833
Mrs. Mia Ayudia, listen to me carefully.

1166
01:31:04,916 --> 01:31:09,708
When I say inhale, you inhale.
When I say push, you push.

1167
01:31:17,416 --> 01:31:19,500
Now take a deep inhale.

1168
01:31:20,458 --> 01:31:21,916
Okay. Now push!

1169
01:31:22,416 --> 01:31:23,416
Push!

1170
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:26,125
Open your eyes. Look at your stomach.

1171
01:31:26,208 --> 01:31:27,500
Come on, Ma'am.

1172
01:31:27,583 --> 01:31:31,583
-More. A little more.
-Come on.

1173
01:31:33,625 --> 01:31:37,583
Easy, Ma’am. Just relax, okay.

1174
01:31:38,166 --> 01:31:40,541
-Hold.
-Ready? On my count.

1175
01:31:40,625 --> 01:31:43,708
Push, push. Harder. Harder.
Open your eyes.

1176
01:31:44,041 --> 01:31:48,083
Push, push harder.

1177
01:31:51,958 --> 01:31:54,041
Keep pushing, Ma'am.

1178
01:31:54,875 --> 01:31:57,291
Push, push.

1179
01:32:16,541 --> 01:32:20,125
Congratulations, Ma’am!
It's a scrappy boy!

1180
01:33:18,958 --> 01:33:22,375
Congratulations, Mr. Alam.
He’s a little champ.

1181
01:33:22,791 --> 01:33:23,875
Thank you, Doctor.

1182
01:33:31,291 --> 01:33:32,125
Dear! Dear!

1183
01:33:32,208 --> 01:33:37,291
Let’s always visit our grandson together.
We’ll have playdates.

1184
01:33:37,375 --> 01:33:39,541
Of course. Promise me.

1185
01:33:39,625 --> 01:33:43,125
Wear this.
For your future second grandchild!

1186
01:33:43,208 --> 01:33:45,000
Thank you.

1187
01:33:47,166 --> 01:33:51,958
You have a son now. Do the best for him.
You’re a father now.

1188
01:33:52,041 --> 01:33:56,291
For your son’s sake, do as I say.

1189
01:33:56,583 --> 01:33:58,083
Move to VIP!

1190
01:33:58,791 --> 01:34:00,666
My grandson!

1191
01:34:24,833 --> 01:34:27,708
You did me proud.

1192
01:34:30,166 --> 01:34:31,500
-I’m proud of you, Ma.
-I'm proud of you.

1193
01:34:33,125 --> 01:34:34,500
I’m proud of you, son.

1194
01:35:16,916 --> 01:35:18,666
MRS. MIA AND MR. ALAM TANJUNG

1195
01:35:58,416 --> 01:35:59,625
My life.

1196
01:36:15,916 --> 01:36:21,333
I would like to publicly apologize
to @faisalPTA

1197
01:36:21,416 --> 01:36:26,875
and withdraw all my statements.
Let’s all be rational adults.

1198
01:36:35,875 --> 01:36:37,208
Look at you.

1199
01:36:45,166 --> 01:36:46,083
I’ll see you soon.

1200
01:36:51,416 --> 01:36:54,458
Amrin, this is my son.

1201
01:36:57,333 --> 01:37:00,541
Amrin, you’re an uncle now.

1202
01:37:05,666 --> 01:37:09,708
Praise God. Is Mia okay? Is your son okay?

1203
01:37:11,791 --> 01:37:15,208
Praise God, everybody’s healthy.

1204
01:37:22,541 --> 01:37:27,541
Amrin, let’s meet up. Our usual place?
