1
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,833
The world of warrior
is like a long and deep tunnel.

2
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:12,041
With the threat of death forever looming
in the darkness.

3
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:17,375
A constant struggle,
one fight after another,

4
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,083
each of them ending with a death.

5
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:27,583
Must that be the warrior's way?

6
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,041
To kill or to be killed.

7
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:11,000
To my mind,

8
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:19,250
The reason to master such skills
is not to become a perfect killer.

9
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:24,666
But to be able to defend the weak

10
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:27,083
and the powerless.

11
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:34,541
What is the meaning of such perfection.

12
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:40,125
If it's not used
for the benefit of humankind?

13
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:57,750
So when a duel ends
with a rival's death

14
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:02,291
it's only loss that I feel.

15
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:08,750
All the more so, as time goes by.

16
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,708
There's much I've lost,

17
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:17,583
but I have also gained.

18
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:24,291
My four students, for instance.

19
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:33,291
Three are the children of
rivals I was forced to kill.

20
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,416
Merah Dara,

21
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:44,375
my younger female student,

22
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,833
is the daughter of Beling Ungu.

23
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,791
Daya Gerhana,

24
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:52,875
is the daughter of Golok Wangi.

25
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,916
Kala Biru,

26
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,791
my oldest and most able student,

27
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,875
is the son of Gagak Hitam.

28
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:05,666
All three are here because
of my feelings of guilt.

29
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:13,416
But Lembah Angin, my youngest student,

30
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:20,083
is here to remind me of my greatest sin

31
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:23,583
I found him.

32
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:28,125
He had been abandoned.

33
00:04:57,458 --> 00:05:01,750
What if I were your enemy?

34
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,291
If such were the case,

35
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,375
only Biru and Angin would still
be standing.

36
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:14,041
I can't say it enough

37
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,958
the greater a fighter's skill,

38
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,250
the more often he'll be attacked
from behind.

39
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,708
That's enough training for today.

40
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:30,250
Biru, Gerhana

41
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:34,166
I want you to go
to the battle arena.

42
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,250
Pay my respects to members
of the High Council

43
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,375
and also to the winner.

44
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:41,708
We will, Guru.

45
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,541
All of you.

46
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,750
We'll meet again tonight.

47
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:01,333
There's something I want to tell you.

48
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,333
Yes, Guru.

49
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,208
The time has come.

50
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:41,875
The Next challenger.

51
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,083
Cempaka's best students

52
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,083
are here again to be mere spectators.

53
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:47,000
Any more challengers?

54
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,625
Your time is near, Biru.

55
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:56,500
Once again, the winner of the battle

56
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,208
is the House of Red Wing.

57
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:06,416
The Honorable High Council,

58
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:11,708
we ask that you present the victory cloth.

59
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,125
As students of Golden Cane House,

60
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:37,291
we express our congratulations
to The House of Red Wing.

61
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:39,791
Our guru, Cempaka,
sends you her greetings.

62
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:41,625
Thank you.

63
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:48,166
Cempaka always sends her students
to watch Red Wing wins.

64
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:50,583
This is an honor for us.

65
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,291
It is we who learn by watching,
it is we who are indebted.

66
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:57,291
Once again,
congratulations to the House of Red Wing.

67
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:58,625
It's time for us to go home.

68
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,333
It will be dark soon.
Stay here for the night.

69
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:02,958
Thank you,

70
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,500
but another time, perhaps.

71
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,416
Guru Cempaka wants us to return home.

72
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:11,458
Give my greetings to her.

73
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,000
Thank you. We will.

74
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:50,625
I don't fear death.

75
00:10:53,541 --> 00:11:00,208
No knowledge in existence
can prevent a person,

76
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,208
from escaping death.

77
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,166
Biru,

78
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:17,791
Gerhana,

79
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:25,041
Dara, and Angin.

80
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:34,625
Although you are not my own children,

81
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:45,500
you know that I have been
a mother for you.

82
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:54,291
Though all of you are skilled fighters,

83
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,291
I must ask,

84
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:07,708
is there one among you
who can resist being a victor?

85
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:20,666
Because, victory in any field
has no meaning

86
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:27,416
if it comes from
another person's demise.

87
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,250
Today,

88
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:35,291
I will give my golden cane to one of you,

89
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:43,166
But I hope all of you will continue
to serve this House.

90
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:48,750
To that same person

91
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:55,583
I will also teach the move known as
Golden Cane Encircles the Earth.

92
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:05,458
That is the ultimate move,

93
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:10,208
the undefeatable move.

94
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:33,833
You must know,

95
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,916
The beauty of this cane,

96
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:44,833
is nothing when compared with its power.

97
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:52,875
That is why this cane
must never fall into the wrong hands.

98
00:13:53,833 --> 00:14:00,833
One of you will inherit this cane.

99
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,750
I've thought about this a long time.

100
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,708
I am giving it to Dara.

101
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,000
But, Guru...

102
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,791
I've spoken.

103
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,583
And you've heard what I said.

104
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:53,500
There's no turning the world back in time.

105
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,041
Accept your duty.

106
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:00,125
Even With this cane in your hand,

107
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,500
It will not be easy.

108
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:17,208
To teach Dara the move,

109
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,958
I will take her away for some time,

110
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,375
to train her.

111
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:30,958
I will take Angin as well to help me
with my remedy.

112
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:36,916
Biru,

113
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:39,208
Gerhana.

114
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,500
Watch over this place until we return.

115
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:45,833
We will, Guru.

116
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,625
Now leave me here with Dara.

117
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:38,958
Hold tightly.

118
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,041
Concentrate your thoughts.

119
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:58,875
Shield your mind from false voices.

120
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:13,916
Now, there is something else
I must tell you.

121
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:34,041
It's too late.

122
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,333
Give me the golden cane.

123
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:58,500
The poison should have worked faster

124
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:01,291
so she could die peacefully in the House.

125
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,750
You two need to know that

126
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:09,208
we did this to prevent her
from making an even worse mistake.

127
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:13,291
She's confused. Addled.

128
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:14,625
I truth is I wish you could be the one.

129
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,375
Run. Get out of here.

130
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:00,125
Who are you?

131
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,333
Where is my brother? Where is my cane?

132
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:17,000
Angin!

133
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:25,291
Tell her to eat.

134
00:24:38,583 --> 00:24:40,041
Are you sure it's not poisoned?

135
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:44,541
Do you trust him?

136
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:51,625
Angin,

137
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:54,125
we must avenge our teacher's death.

138
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,250
Listen to me.

139
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:04,750
Guru Cempaka told me something
the night before she died.

140
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:11,416
She said that if anything happened to her

141
00:25:11,541 --> 00:25:15,125
before she could teach me the final move,

142
00:25:17,375 --> 00:25:21,750
I was to find a warrior
by the name of Naga Putih.

143
00:25:25,541 --> 00:25:28,875
She said that he is the only
other person who has mastered that move.

144
00:25:32,708 --> 00:25:36,291
You know of this?

145
00:25:49,875 --> 00:25:53,750
We convey our condolences for the death
of your teacher, Cempaka

146
00:25:53,875 --> 00:25:57,458
and the loss of the golden cane as well.

147
00:26:02,583 --> 00:26:04,666
We never would have thought,

148
00:26:06,583 --> 00:26:11,541
they would poison her
and steal the golden cane.

149
00:26:12,833 --> 00:26:17,666
Mobilize our students
to track down Dara and Angin.

150
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,750
Yes, Guru.

151
00:26:19,875 --> 00:26:25,666
Cempaka's death is a tragic loss
for the world of warriors.

152
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,625
Thank you for saying so.

153
00:26:28,291 --> 00:26:30,375
That is actually the reason
we've come here.

154
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:33,625
Our teacher greatly respected you.

155
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:38,458
We hope that you will permit us
to join The Red Wing House.

156
00:26:40,416 --> 00:26:46,833
To have Cempaka's students here
would be a great honor.

157
00:26:49,958 --> 00:26:55,000
Convey this sad news to the High Council.

158
00:26:56,833 --> 00:27:00,333
Prepare the finest of burial ceremonies.

159
00:27:00,458 --> 00:27:03,333
This will serve as a measure
of our final respect

160
00:27:03,458 --> 00:27:06,750
for Cempaka, the Golden Cane Warrior.

161
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:16,833
Our House will reward anyone who is able
to help Biru and Gerhana

162
00:27:16,958 --> 00:27:19,625
retrieve the golden cane.

163
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:22,125
The cane is Biru's by right.

164
00:27:22,583 --> 00:27:24,250
Yes, Guru.

165
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,208
Any regrets?

166
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:07,666
Regrets? None at all.

167
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:51,375
Don't force your body.

168
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:57,250
Your body needs time to recover.

169
00:30:29,583 --> 00:30:31,500
I am going away for a few days.

170
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:35,333
You and your brother may stay here
until you have recovered.

171
00:31:20,375 --> 00:31:22,583
We share in your grief
for Cempaka's passing.

172
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:27,583
Our House will help to avenge the pain
that Dara and Angin caused.

173
00:31:28,291 --> 00:31:31,791
Thank you. You show us great honor.

174
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:26,416
Wherever they've hidden,

175
00:32:27,541 --> 00:32:30,541
we'll find them.

176
00:32:32,416 --> 00:32:34,041
Just be patient.

177
00:32:34,541 --> 00:32:36,833
We trust you, Guru.

178
00:32:36,958 --> 00:32:39,291
And no matter what happens,

179
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:42,958
we'll always be grateful
for being allowed to join your House.

180
00:32:43,541 --> 00:32:46,625
Your new fellow students

181
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:51,583
will help you find Dara and Angin.

182
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,375
And once you catch them,

183
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:59,041
I will not interfere with you in
how you want to settle the score.

184
00:33:00,291 --> 00:33:03,666
That matter I leave entirely to you.

185
00:33:04,541 --> 00:33:08,125
You don't have to serve me.

186
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:11,375
There are other students who can do that.

187
00:33:14,666 --> 00:33:21,583
This is but a sign of thanks
for accepting us

188
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:24,583
and appointing us as your lead students.

189
00:33:25,125 --> 00:33:30,333
I see that Cempaka taught you
more than just to fight,

190
00:33:30,458 --> 00:33:33,375
she taught you to be
a good person as well.

191
00:33:34,375 --> 00:33:36,875
My respect for her excellence.

192
00:33:51,083 --> 00:33:55,291
It's Elang. Elang's here.

193
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:47,166
My brother and I don't know
how to repay you for all you've done.

194
00:34:48,916 --> 00:34:51,125
You were in trouble.

195
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,875
It was our duty to help.

196
00:34:58,916 --> 00:35:00,833
Don't worry. You're safe here.

197
00:35:36,708 --> 00:35:39,958
Do you know where to find Naga Putih?

198
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:49,333
How did you know that
we're looking for Naga Putih?

199
00:35:51,125 --> 00:35:52,625
Just who are you, anyway?

200
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:10,250
This should tell you that
you still need a lot more training.

201
00:36:14,291 --> 00:36:17,916
Tomorrow I have to go away again,
it's up to you.

202
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:23,250
Go on looking for Naga Putih
not knowing where he is,

203
00:36:23,375 --> 00:36:26,375
or wait for me to take you to him.

204
00:36:34,541 --> 00:36:35,500
Angin.

205
00:37:37,166 --> 00:37:38,291
It's Elang.

206
00:39:10,875 --> 00:39:12,875
This is the third time I've come.

207
00:39:13,583 --> 00:39:14,958
Now pay your debt.

208
00:40:24,375 --> 00:40:25,416
Angin!

209
00:41:32,041 --> 00:41:34,083
We have to help the villagers.

210
00:41:43,625 --> 00:41:44,666
Do you know this person?

211
00:41:45,125 --> 00:41:46,583
She's not here.

212
00:41:54,416 --> 00:41:55,791
Where is she?

213
00:41:57,666 --> 00:42:00,541
Where have you hidden her?

214
00:42:04,583 --> 00:42:05,291
Dara!

215
00:42:07,583 --> 00:42:08,291
Angin!

216
00:42:10,083 --> 00:42:10,875
Come out!

217
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:14,666
Or we'll burn this place down!

218
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:58,500
Stop!

219
00:44:25,083 --> 00:44:26,416
Please forgive me.

220
00:44:26,875 --> 00:44:28,208
Forgive us.

221
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:32,625
None of this would have happened
if we hadn't been here.

222
00:44:34,458 --> 00:44:36,000
Where is Angin?

223
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:41,750
He gave himself up
to save the people here.

224
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:44,250
The attackers left a message.

225
00:44:44,833 --> 00:44:46,958
Biru is waiting for you at the House.

226
00:44:47,875 --> 00:44:50,791
Angin can be traded for the golden cane.

227
00:44:51,208 --> 00:44:54,125
Biru promised not to involve
the other Houses.

228
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,500
Again, forgive me,

229
00:44:56,916 --> 00:44:58,875
but now I must try to save Angin.

230
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:05,750
This time listen and trust me.

231
00:45:05,875 --> 00:45:08,166
You don't know enough yet
to save yourself,

232
00:45:08,291 --> 00:45:09,583
let alone to save Angin.

233
00:45:14,666 --> 00:45:16,875
Maybe you are a great fighter,

234
00:45:17,666 --> 00:45:20,541
and I am the reason
for the disturbance here.

235
00:45:21,541 --> 00:45:24,833
But you have no right
to judge my capabilities.

236
00:45:26,208 --> 00:45:28,958
And definitely no right to prevent me
from trying to save Angin.

237
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:02,791
Say something.

238
00:46:03,583 --> 00:46:05,750
I know you can talk.

239
00:46:16,291 --> 00:46:18,708
Tell me where Dara is,
and the golden cane.

240
00:46:20,291 --> 00:46:23,166
Tell me and I'll give you
the chance to live

241
00:46:23,291 --> 00:46:27,958
and to know how it feels to be an adult.

242
00:46:32,166 --> 00:46:33,625
You're just a kid.

243
00:46:39,416 --> 00:46:42,291
You don't know what Gerhana and I feel.

244
00:46:44,458 --> 00:46:47,125
Cempaka killed our parents,

245
00:46:49,791 --> 00:46:52,333
then took us to be her students.

246
00:46:56,958 --> 00:46:58,333
And just when we were starting to enjoy

247
00:46:58,458 --> 00:47:01,291
the fame and the power
of Golden Cane House.

248
00:47:02,875 --> 00:47:07,541
She shut it down
and moved us to this dump of a place.

249
00:47:18,583 --> 00:47:21,958
After all that time
serving the Golden Cane,

250
00:47:25,041 --> 00:47:26,791
look at what happened.

251
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:38,208
Tell me where to find Dara
and the golden cane, Angin.

252
00:47:57,208 --> 00:48:00,041
Once it is in my hand,

253
00:48:00,166 --> 00:48:06,375
I will bring back to this House
the fame and power Cempaka disavowed.

254
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:15,250
And I will give you an honorable position.

255
00:48:59,625 --> 00:49:02,166
You took an oath, Elang.

256
00:49:04,916 --> 00:49:07,250
I know that you could help Dara,

257
00:49:09,416 --> 00:49:11,958
but not in this battle.

258
00:49:12,083 --> 00:49:14,958
Dara will not be able
to defend herself alone.

259
00:49:15,083 --> 00:49:17,708
We can only wait and see.

260
00:49:18,916 --> 00:49:21,083
If they should die,

261
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:25,708
you know what you have to do.

262
00:49:27,916 --> 00:49:31,791
Right now, the important thing

263
00:49:31,916 --> 00:49:34,333
is the villagers' safety.

264
00:49:35,708 --> 00:49:40,583
You must lead them to a safer place.

265
00:50:19,208 --> 00:50:22,208
It's Dara and the golden cane.

266
00:50:22,625 --> 00:50:25,833
I have no time
for small talk with you, Gerhana.

267
00:50:25,958 --> 00:50:26,625
Where is Angin?

268
00:50:27,166 --> 00:50:28,666
Is this what you're looking for?

269
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:40,041
Do you want the cane?

270
00:50:45,541 --> 00:50:46,250
Then release Angin.

271
00:50:50,375 --> 00:50:55,166
The cane is mine, you should know that.

272
00:50:56,291 --> 00:51:00,041
You'll never be the Golden Cane Warrior.

273
00:51:00,166 --> 00:51:01,333
No one ever will.

274
00:51:04,041 --> 00:51:08,083
The only true heir was the one
you have killed cowardly.

275
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:13,708
Stupid girl.

276
00:51:16,416 --> 00:51:18,416
I am far more skilled than you, Dara.

277
00:51:21,333 --> 00:51:25,125
I'm not going to attack
because you point that cane at me.

278
00:51:28,041 --> 00:51:32,541
Its power doesn't depend
on the final move.

279
00:51:35,375 --> 00:51:36,750
Take this useless kid,

280
00:51:37,458 --> 00:51:38,916
and give the cane to me.

281
00:51:40,916 --> 00:51:42,166
Untie him.

282
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:51,333
Angin.

283
00:53:39,041 --> 00:53:41,708
Angin, Dara.

284
00:53:42,125 --> 00:53:43,541
Where are you?

285
00:53:45,125 --> 00:53:47,833
Show your faces
and let me send your souls to heaven.

286
00:54:18,625 --> 00:54:20,500
It's only me here.

287
00:54:25,416 --> 00:54:27,666
So, you can speak after all.

288
00:54:28,333 --> 00:54:31,583
The good of heart wants nothing,
though he could have it all.

289
00:54:31,708 --> 00:54:35,000
The small of heart wants everything
but will gain nothing.

290
00:55:30,708 --> 00:55:33,208
It's a waste of time looking for her.

291
00:55:34,791 --> 00:55:37,958
Let the weakling rot
wherever she's hiding.

292
00:56:27,166 --> 00:56:34,041
I'm glad to see the golden cane
is back in your hands.

293
00:56:35,958 --> 00:56:40,000
Cempaka can now rest more calmly.

294
00:56:40,625 --> 00:56:45,625
We have you to thank for that.

295
00:56:47,666 --> 00:56:50,750
Even so, you still have to find Dara.

296
00:56:52,416 --> 00:56:54,375
No matter what,

297
00:56:55,083 --> 00:56:57,583
you can't let her remain free.

298
00:56:58,791 --> 00:56:59,333
We won't, Guru.

299
00:57:15,666 --> 00:57:21,333
The villagers who sheltered them

300
00:57:21,458 --> 00:57:24,166
also bear responsibility.

301
00:57:24,833 --> 00:57:27,833
We'll see they pay as well.

302
01:02:20,791 --> 01:02:23,958
If I should die,

303
01:02:26,375 --> 01:02:33,208
I want you to lead this House.

304
01:02:37,541 --> 01:02:44,291
Show this place the same respect

305
01:02:44,416 --> 01:02:54,375
like Cempaka did with her Golden Cane.

306
01:02:59,708 --> 01:03:01,458
I will, Guru.

307
01:03:02,791 --> 01:03:05,000
But please, Guru,
don't speak of death again.

308
01:03:20,375 --> 01:03:21,708
How much longer?

309
01:03:22,208 --> 01:03:26,416
Tonight's cup of tea
should keep him from waking again.

310
01:03:45,958 --> 01:03:46,750
Take them down.

311
01:04:02,333 --> 01:04:05,291
I have important announcements to make.

312
01:04:07,166 --> 01:04:11,083
Henceforth, Biru replaces Cempaka
as Warrior of the Golden Cane.

313
01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:17,166
This House shall now go
by the name of The Golden Cane.

314
01:04:17,625 --> 01:04:21,666
And there will be no more competitions
in the arena

315
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:26,541
because no one can defeat
the Golden Cane Warrior.

316
01:04:26,666 --> 01:04:29,833
Spread this news to all fighters
and their Houses,

317
01:04:29,958 --> 01:04:32,583
Golden Cane will be the highest
and most powerful House.

318
01:04:33,833 --> 01:04:35,583
Let no one dare to try to stop this.

319
01:04:35,708 --> 01:04:36,208
But, Biru...

320
01:04:36,291 --> 01:04:37,875
Call him “Guru”.

321
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,833
But Guru, the High Council...

322
01:04:50,583 --> 01:04:53,750
There is no High Council any more.

323
01:04:54,875 --> 01:04:57,000
Just as Biru said,

324
01:04:58,125 --> 01:05:01,041
Golden Cane is now the highest authority.

325
01:06:43,916 --> 01:06:47,541
I'm sorry but I had to do that.

326
01:06:49,583 --> 01:06:52,666
I should have helped you
when you tried to save Angin,

327
01:06:55,250 --> 01:06:56,708
but I couldn't.

328
01:06:58,541 --> 01:06:59,833
I wasn't allowed to help.

329
01:07:01,958 --> 01:07:04,000
Tell me who you are.

330
01:07:06,208 --> 01:07:08,833
I want to know your story.

331
01:07:10,916 --> 01:07:14,083
That and your relationship
with Naga Putih.

332
01:07:21,458 --> 01:07:24,875
Naga Putih left this world some time ago.

333
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:28,750
I will tell you everything.

334
01:07:31,916 --> 01:07:34,458
I can't kill anymore.

335
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Not even the blackest of souls.

336
01:07:39,958 --> 01:07:46,583
Your decision means that
more victims will fall.

337
01:07:46,708 --> 01:07:50,708
The weak and the powerless.

338
01:07:51,166 --> 01:07:55,833
The innocent and the defenseless.

339
01:07:55,958 --> 01:08:01,875
Retire after you have mastered
the ultimate move.

340
01:08:03,125 --> 01:08:05,000
Forgive me, Guru.

341
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:08,958
I will not change my mind.

342
01:08:11,333 --> 01:08:15,875
Cempaka is capable
of following my footsteps.

343
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,875
To her I shall give the golden cane.

344
01:08:20,541 --> 01:08:26,000
It's fitting that she be given it
and to lead this House.

345
01:08:26,791 --> 01:08:30,708
This isn't just about
who gets the golden cane.

346
01:08:34,958 --> 01:08:39,708
The move of the
Golden Cane Encircles the Earth,

347
01:08:39,833 --> 01:08:42,375
can only be done in pairs.

348
01:08:43,666 --> 01:08:46,375
If the House is to live on,

349
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:50,458
you must find two students

350
01:08:50,583 --> 01:08:54,958
who are able to master it.

351
01:08:55,083 --> 01:09:00,875
Don't die before that happens.

352
01:09:02,291 --> 01:09:04,791
You, too, Naga Putih,

353
01:09:04,916 --> 01:09:10,083
must pass on your knowledge to
at least two students.

354
01:09:10,916 --> 01:09:16,458
The power of the golden cane
must not be lost.

355
01:09:16,583 --> 01:09:21,041
Your knowledge endows you
with responsibility.

356
01:09:22,333 --> 01:09:24,125
I understand, Guru.

357
01:09:25,958 --> 01:09:28,083
I will pass down the knowledge.

358
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:32,833
Make sure you choose the right person.

359
01:09:35,666 --> 01:09:40,833
Now you two go
and settle your personal affairs.

360
01:09:41,458 --> 01:09:46,666
And don't come back until you do.

361
01:10:48,333 --> 01:10:49,458
Cempaka.

362
01:10:52,125 --> 01:10:59,916
Do you still want to lead the House,
to keep on fighting, and to leave me?

363
01:11:05,041 --> 01:11:08,000
Won't you change your mind?

364
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:15,000
It's not just because I'm unable
to ignore the teacher's request.

365
01:11:18,041 --> 01:11:21,458
It's my conscience, Naga,
a voice inside telling me that

366
01:11:21,583 --> 01:11:24,708
I must continue this noble task.

367
01:11:25,833 --> 01:11:28,166
Well then, warrior,

368
01:11:30,125 --> 01:11:37,708
I ask you to swear to
never come looking for me.

369
01:11:45,791 --> 01:11:47,833
In turn, I will swear that,

370
01:11:48,833 --> 01:11:55,125
neither I nor our son will ever bother
you or intervene in your affairs.

371
01:12:01,916 --> 01:12:03,583
Swear this to me, Cempaka.

372
01:12:09,291 --> 01:12:11,583
I swear.

373
01:12:36,625 --> 01:12:37,333
And so you are...

374
01:12:37,458 --> 01:12:39,875
I am the son of Naga Putih and Cempaka.

375
01:12:41,875 --> 01:12:43,708
The sole owner to knowledge
of the golden's cane's ultimate move.

376
01:12:48,750 --> 01:12:50,208
Dara,

377
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,333
just as my father once swore.

378
01:12:55,041 --> 01:12:56,791
I, too, was made to swear that

379
01:12:56,916 --> 01:12:58,875
I would not intervene
in this affair of yours.

380
01:13:01,791 --> 01:13:05,375
Forgive me for being unable to help
when you tried to save Angin.

381
01:13:08,333 --> 01:13:10,125
Now I see,

382
01:13:11,958 --> 01:13:16,666
why Cempaka asked Angin to come
when she was going to teach me that move.

383
01:13:18,666 --> 01:13:22,125
Angin was to learn it, too, because
the move can only be done in pairs.

384
01:13:23,416 --> 01:13:25,875
I was my father's only student.

385
01:13:26,458 --> 01:13:28,791
He was my pair.

386
01:13:33,791 --> 01:13:35,291
Now, I have just one duty.

387
01:13:36,375 --> 01:13:40,333
To ensure sure that the final move is
passed onto Cempaka's choice of student.

388
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:43,250
If she died before she could pass it on.

389
01:13:50,083 --> 01:13:53,916
Elang, accept me as your student.

390
01:13:54,041 --> 01:13:59,083
Help me to perfect my skills and to pass
on to me knowledge of the ultimate move.

391
01:13:59,208 --> 01:14:02,333
Help me to avenge
the deaths of Cempaka and Angin.

392
01:14:02,458 --> 01:14:04,500
I will follow your instructions.

393
01:14:09,041 --> 01:14:14,000
Mastery of the final move requires
more than just two skilled warriors.

394
01:14:14,666 --> 01:14:20,458
The two must be able to unify
their thoughts and breath as one.

395
01:14:20,875 --> 01:14:24,583
Much time and patience
will be needed to master the move.

396
01:14:26,666 --> 01:14:32,500
For Cempaka, Angin and all warriors
who gave this cane its value and meaning.

397
01:14:32,625 --> 01:14:35,083
Unite the two of us to
so that we can retrieve the cane.

398
01:17:38,875 --> 01:17:42,000
Before she died,
Cempaka often went off by herself.

399
01:17:42,708 --> 01:17:45,708
I think now that she was looking for you.

400
01:17:49,708 --> 01:17:50,833
All that is past now.

401
01:17:55,375 --> 01:17:57,208
It will be night soon.

402
01:17:59,916 --> 01:18:03,750
You've mastered all the basic moves.

403
01:18:03,875 --> 01:18:07,166
Tomorrow we'll start to practice
the ultimate move.

404
01:19:53,625 --> 01:19:59,125
Forces of evil now control
the world of warriors.

405
01:20:01,625 --> 01:20:07,125
We must combine
forces and launch a joint attack.

406
01:20:07,250 --> 01:20:12,291
No, that will only diminish our defenses.

407
01:20:12,625 --> 01:20:14,750
Golden Cane House
is too large and powerful.

408
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:17,833
Most other Houses have joined with them

409
01:20:17,958 --> 01:20:21,375
to share in the power of Biru
and the golden cane.

410
01:20:26,291 --> 01:20:28,125
We'll send another warrior.

411
01:20:43,291 --> 01:20:46,458
For the third time
in as many months yet,

412
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:52,875
another fool has tried to kill me
and take the golden cane.

413
01:20:58,166 --> 01:21:04,541
I am the rightful heir
of the golden cane.

414
01:21:07,375 --> 01:21:09,291
With this cane,

415
01:21:10,125 --> 01:21:15,750
I guarantee the power and fame of
this place within the world of warriors.

416
01:21:33,250 --> 01:21:34,916
Anyone who dares defy me,

417
01:21:36,750 --> 01:21:38,500
will meet their death.

418
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:54,583
We may have killed Cempaka too soon.

419
01:23:14,750 --> 01:23:18,291
I have yet to discover
the power of this cane.

420
01:23:22,458 --> 01:23:24,333
Without knowledge of the ultimate move,

421
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:29,208
this cane is no different from any other.

422
01:23:32,375 --> 01:23:33,708
Biru,

423
01:23:35,041 --> 01:23:38,666
Cempaka took that knowledge to her death.

424
01:23:39,958 --> 01:23:42,416
There's nothing to regret.

425
01:23:44,458 --> 01:23:47,833
No one else can possibly
know of it either.

426
01:23:50,458 --> 01:23:54,208
Even without the golden cane,
you are an incredible fighter.

427
01:23:54,333 --> 01:23:56,083
Invincible.

428
01:23:57,750 --> 01:24:01,166
And with the golden cane in your hand,

429
01:24:01,291 --> 01:24:04,083
everyone will submit to you.

430
01:24:07,125 --> 01:24:10,333
But I think the elders are suspicious.

431
01:24:16,583 --> 01:24:19,458
Then it's time to finish them off.

432
01:24:20,416 --> 01:24:22,666
They're the main obstacle.

433
01:24:23,666 --> 01:24:26,583
Useless old men.

434
01:25:24,583 --> 01:25:31,250
Dark forces have controlled
the warriors' world

435
01:25:31,333 --> 01:25:34,916
for so long now.

436
01:25:37,125 --> 01:25:40,333
We are all paralyzed.

437
01:25:43,041 --> 01:25:51,625
And, yet, Biru and Gerhana
remain undefeated.

438
01:25:53,083 --> 01:25:55,166
Dara is ready, Uncle.

439
01:25:58,666 --> 01:26:04,208
We now have the chance
to bring them down

440
01:26:04,333 --> 01:26:06,583
and to retrieve the golden cane.

441
01:26:08,958 --> 01:26:18,375
If you have decided to serve
as Dara's pair in fighting them,

442
01:26:20,291 --> 01:26:25,625
you will betray your oath.

443
01:26:27,666 --> 01:26:35,166
I was the witness,

444
01:26:35,291 --> 01:26:42,833
when you swore to your father that,

445
01:26:42,958 --> 01:26:48,666
you would not intervene.

446
01:26:51,250 --> 01:26:53,958
You know the penalty, Elang.

447
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,541
But the interests of the majority
are greater than my own.

448
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:04,750
I have no other choice.

449
01:27:37,791 --> 01:27:40,250
Concentrate your mind.

450
01:27:42,541 --> 01:27:45,250
The time has arrived.

451
01:28:21,125 --> 01:28:21,916
Guru.

452
01:28:22,333 --> 01:28:23,083
What is it?

453
01:28:23,625 --> 01:28:27,791
Two outsiders are causing a disturbance
in the arena.

454
01:29:12,458 --> 01:29:13,458
Stop!

455
01:29:21,208 --> 01:29:22,208
Who are you?

456
01:29:25,125 --> 01:29:27,375
Why are you causing a disturbance
for no reason?

457
01:29:29,250 --> 01:29:31,250
There's a reason, Biru.

458
01:29:32,541 --> 01:29:35,125
We're here to meet you and Gerhana.

459
01:29:36,916 --> 01:29:40,458
The time has come for you to return
the golden cane to its rightful owner.

460
01:29:40,916 --> 01:29:43,250
You're out of your mind.

461
01:29:43,375 --> 01:29:46,250
Biru is the rightful owner
of the golden cane.

462
01:29:54,583 --> 01:29:56,958
I've come here to recover my right,

463
01:29:57,083 --> 01:29:59,000
the Golden Cane.

464
01:29:59,125 --> 01:30:00,708
Without bloodshed.

465
01:30:01,208 --> 01:30:03,375
If you refuse to give it to me,

466
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:07,000
I challenge you to a fair fight.

467
01:30:07,125 --> 01:30:10,625
Just the two of you
against the two of us,

468
01:30:10,750 --> 01:30:13,291
with no outside help.

469
01:30:14,625 --> 01:30:16,583
In the same arena you closed down

470
01:30:16,708 --> 01:30:19,875
after you stole the golden came from me.

471
01:30:22,791 --> 01:30:24,250
All of you, listen to me.

472
01:30:24,375 --> 01:30:27,208
We accept the challenge.

473
01:30:27,333 --> 01:30:29,875
None of you are to interfere.

474
01:30:31,375 --> 01:30:32,250
It's only right that this woman

475
01:30:32,375 --> 01:30:35,083
who killed our teacher
and our brother Angin.

476
01:30:37,375 --> 01:30:39,833
She should die in our hands.

477
01:33:12,666 --> 01:33:13,583
Mother.

478
01:33:23,083 --> 01:33:24,958
Not in front of your daughter, Gerhana.

479
01:33:34,666 --> 01:33:37,625
There's only one place
to finish this fight.

480
01:33:38,458 --> 01:33:40,541
I can finish you off anywhere.

481
01:35:29,458 --> 01:35:31,666
You're using moves of the golden cane.

482
01:35:31,791 --> 01:35:34,000
Dara couldn't have taught them to you.

483
01:35:34,125 --> 01:35:35,291
Who are you?

484
01:39:58,083 --> 01:40:00,375
The golden cane is now back
in your hands, Dara.

485
01:40:02,791 --> 01:40:05,375
Your teacher and Angin
did not die in vain.

486
01:40:07,375 --> 01:40:09,625
Your mother and Angin, Elang.

487
01:40:11,958 --> 01:40:13,375
Your mother.

488
01:40:13,875 --> 01:40:16,708
Yes, my mother.

489
01:42:26,375 --> 01:42:31,625
A true warrior holds true
to his promises, Elang.

490
01:42:36,791 --> 01:42:42,166
Yet to be true means
to live in a silent world.

491
01:42:42,833 --> 01:42:44,416
I understand, Uncle.

492
01:42:46,583 --> 01:42:48,666
Having betrayed my oath,

493
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,333
I must pay the penalty.

494
01:43:57,583 --> 01:44:04,625
The world of the warrior
is like a long and deep tunnel.

495
01:44:07,750 --> 01:44:10,958
Wherever you turn,

496
01:44:12,125 --> 01:44:19,125
all you find is the threat of death
in the darkness.

497
01:44:23,666 --> 01:44:28,375
And while there is light at the end of

498
01:44:28,458 --> 01:44:35,333
even the longest and darkest of tunnels.

499
01:44:40,416 --> 01:44:43,666
But whether that light

500
01:44:43,750 --> 01:44:50,500
represents hope or menace,

501
01:44:50,625 --> 01:44:53,208
one can never know.
